PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
Document Control
This Phase 2 deliverable of the PreOne Enterprise ADR Series presents Volume
1 — Architecture Foundation. It contains 20 Architecture Decision Records
(ADR-001 to ADR-020) that define the foundational principles, structural rules,
and technology stack on which all subsequent volumes build. Every ADR in this
volume follows the 34-section v3.0 template defined in Phase 1 (ADR-000).
Each ADR includes four ASCII diagrams (architecture, sequence, component,
data flow) and is linked to upstream DDD/PRD documents and downstream
ERD/API/UI/Test artefacts per the cross-reference framework established in
Phase 1.

ADR-001 to ADR-020 - 20 decisions - 34 sections each
Volume 1 defines the foundational architectural principles, structural
rules, and technology stack that all subsequent volumes build upon. The
20 ADRs in this volume are the most-referenced in the entire 160-ADR
corpus. ADR-001 establishes 10 canonical principles that govern every
subsequent decision. ADR-002 through ADR-013 define the structural
patterns: modular monolith, clean architecture, DDD, bounded contexts,
layering, dependency rules, SOLID, hexagonal architecture, package
structure, coding standards, naming standards, and project structure.
ADR-014 through ADR-016 define the operational foundation:
configuration hierarchy, environment strategy, and feature flags.
ADR-017 through ADR-020 define the delivery foundation: build pipeline,
deployment model, versioning policy, and the technology stack freeze.
Together, these 20 ADRs are the constitution of the PreOne platform.

CONTEXT
PreOne is a multi-tenant SaaS platform serving the preschool education market
across India. The platform must support hundreds of schools, thousands of
branches, and millions of students, parents, teachers, and administrators while
complying with stringent child-data protection regulations. Before v1.0,
architectural decisions were made ad-hoc by individual feature teams, leading
to fragmentation: three different caching strategies, two different
authentication mechanisms, and inconsistent API conventions across modules.
The Office of the Chief Architect was established in Q2 2025 to unify
architectural direction. The first deliverable was a set of canonical principles
that every team would align to. These principles are not technology choices —
they are value statements that bound the solution space for every downstream
ADR. Technology choices (Java 21, PostgreSQL 16, etc.) are captured in
ADR-020 and must comply with these principles. The principles were drafted
through a series of workshops with engineering, product, security, and
operations leadership over six weeks. Each principle was stress-tested against
real PreOne scenarios: a school onboarding 500 students in a single day, a
parent accessing their child's report card on mobile, a regulator auditing data
retention. The 10 principles below are the result of that stress-testing.
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary business driver is platform scalability: PreOne must scale from 50
schools (current) to 5,000 schools (5-year target) without architectural rework.
Fragmented architecture cannot scale because each new team reinvents
foundations, multiplying operational cost. Unified principles compress the
decision space so that new teams build on the same foundations as existing
teams. The secondary driver is compliance: preschool data is subject to
multiple regulations (DPDP Act 2023, COPPA-equivalent norms, state-level
child protection laws). Principles that bake privacy-by-design and audit-by-
default into every decision reduce the compliance burden per feature. The
tertiary driver is onboarding speed: new engineers can be productive in 2-3

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
weeks when principles are explicit, versus 8-12 weeks when they must reverse-
engineer conventions from code.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Architectural decisions across PreOne feature teams are inconsistent, leading
to operational fragmentation, compliance risk, and slow onboarding. We need a
small set of canonical principles that every team aligns to, enforced through
code review and ADR governance.
CONSTRAINTS
● Principles must be technology-agnostic — they outlive any specific
stack choice
● Principles must be testable — each must have a concrete verification
mechanism
● Principles must be memorable — engineers should be able to recite
them without lookup
● Principles must be ordered — when two principles conflict, the earlier
one takes precedence
● Principles must be applicable to both greenfield and brownfield work
ASSUMPTIONS
● PreOne will remain a multi-tenant SaaS platform for the foreseeable
future (no pivot to on-premise)
● The engineering organisation will grow from ~40 engineers (current)
to ~150 engineers (3-year target)
● The regulatory environment will tighten, not loosen, over the next 5
years
● Cloud infrastructure (AWS) will remain the deployment substrate
● The platform will continue to serve the preschool education market (no
expansion to K-12 in scope)

DECISION
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  8

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADOPTED
We adopt the following 10 canonical architecture principles, in precedence
order. Every ADR in the PreOne corpus must explicitly cite which
principle(s) it serves, and the ARB must verify alignment during review. (1)
Tenant isolation is non-negotiable. (2) Data integrity over performance. (3)
Security by default, not by retrofit. (4) Observability is a feature, not an
afterthought. (5) Simplicity over cleverness. (6) Build for evolution, not for
prediction. (7) Contracts before code. (8) Fail loud, fail fast, fail safe. (9)
Automate everything repeatable. (10) Document every decision that
survives a week.
DETAILED RATIONALE
The 10 principles were chosen because they collectively cover the full surface
area of architectural concern at PreOne without overlap. Tenant isolation (P1)
is first because a multi-tenant SaaS that leaks data between tenants is not just a
bug — it is an existential business risk; everything else is secondary if isolation
fails. Data integrity (P2) precedes performance (covered implicitly in P5 and
P6) because a fast platform that corrupts data is worse than a slow platform
that preserves it; performance can be optimised, but trust lost to corruption
cannot be regained. Security (P3) and observability (P4) are placed before
simplicity (P5) because PreOne handles child data — a single breach is a
regulatory and reputational event that could end the company. Simplicity is
valued but never at the expense of security or observability. Build for evolution
(P6) reflects the reality that PreOne's product direction will shift; architectures
that lock in current assumptions (e.g., hard-coding academic year as a single
global value) create expensive rework when the assumption breaks. Contracts
before code (P7) ensures that API and data contracts are designed before
implementation, preventing the common failure mode where the contract is
reverse-engineered from the code (and thus inherits all the code's accidents).
Fail loud (P8) rejects silent failure modes — exceptions that are swallowed,
defaults that mask misconfiguration — because silent failures in a child-data
platform are how breaches happen. Automate everything repeatable (P9) is the
principle that justifies the CI/CD, IaC, and testing investments in Volumes 6 and
8. Document every decision (P10) is the meta-principle that justifies the ADR
corpus itself. The most likely counter-argument is that 10 principles are too
many to enforce rigorously. The counter-counter-argument is that enforcement
is not via human vigilance but via the ADR workflow: every Proposed ADR must
list which principles it serves (or explicitly state it does not serve any, which is
itself a flag for ARB review). This makes enforcement mechanical, not
discretionary.

DATABASE IMPACT
No direct database impact. The principles are abstract and do not prescribe
schema, storage, or indexing choices. However, P1 (Tenant Isolation) and P2
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 10

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
(Data Integrity) directly constrain every database ADR in Volume 3: ADR-043
(Multi-Tenant), ADR-044 (School Isolation), ADR-047 (Soft Delete), and
ADR-048 (Audit Trail) are all implementations of these principles at the data
layer. The principle citation in each Volume 3 ADR's Context section creates a
traceable link from concrete schema choices back to foundational values.
API IMPACT
No direct API impact. However, P7 (Contracts Before Code) is the foundational
principle for Volume 5 (API & Integration). Every API ADR — ADR-091 (REST),
ADR-092 (Versioning), ADR-093 (Error Codes), ADR-106 (Idempotency) — cites
P7 in its rationale. The principle enforces the workflow: OpenAPI specs are
reviewed and merged before implementation PRs are accepted; a PR that
introduces an endpoint not in the spec is blocked by CI.
UI IMPACT
No direct UI impact. However, P4 (Observability) and P8 (Fail Loud) influence
UI behaviour: errors are surfaced to users with clear, actionable messages (not
silent failures); loading states are explicit (not blank screens); offline states are
communicated (ADR-142). P5 (Simplicity) governs UI design system choices in
Volume 7 — component count is kept minimal, composition is preferred over
configuration.
SECURITY IMPACT
P3 (Security by Default) is the foundational security principle. Every Volume 4
ADR must cite P3. The principle means: authentication is required by default
(opt-out requires ARB approval); encryption is enabled by default; audit logging
is on by default; rate limiting is on by default. Opting out of any default security
control requires an ADR that justifies the exception and is approved by both the
Domain Architect and the Security Officer. This inverts the traditional model
where security is added later — at PreOne, security is the starting point and
removal requires justification.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
P2 (Data Integrity over Performance) explicitly accepts performance trade-offs
in favour of correctness. For example, we choose serialisable transaction
isolation (not read-committed) for financial data, accepting the latency cost. P5
(Simplicity) reduces performance overhead by avoiding over-engineering — no
premature optimisation, no speculative caching. Performance optimisation is
permitted only when (a) a measured bottleneck is documented, (b) the
optimisation does not violate P1-P4, and (c) the optimisation is captured in an
ADR.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 11

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
The principles scale with the organisation. At 40 engineers, the 10 principles
are reinforced through code review and team leads. At 150 engineers (3-year
target), the principles are enforced through CI pipeline checks (linting for
security defaults, contract tests for API specs, coverage thresholds for
observability). At 500+ engineers, the principles are embedded in onboarding
and in the architecture review workflow. The ceiling is not the principles
themselves but the enforcement mechanism — which is why ADR-158 (ARB)
and ADR-159 (Decision Governance) exist as the scalability backstop.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
P4 (Observability) and P9 (Automate) have direct operational implications.
Every service must emit structured logs (JSON), metrics (Prometheus format),
and traces (OpenTelemetry) — this is verified at deploy time. Every repeatable
operational task (deployment, backup, restore, scaling) must be automated —
manual runbooks are permitted only for genuinely novel incidents. The on-call
engineer should never perform a task that could have been automated; if they
do, a follow-up ticket to automate it is mandatory.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
The 25-principle option was rejected because cognitive load tests showed
engineers could recite at most 7-10 principles from memory; beyond that, they
look them up, which means the principles function as documentation rather
than as internalised values. The 5-principle option was rejected because the 5
candidates (isolation, integrity, security, observability, simplicity) were too
abstract to resolve common disputes — for example, 'contracts before code' and
'fail loud' are both expressions of simplicity but guide different concrete
decisions. The no-principles option was rejected because the pre-v1.0 state of
the platform demonstrated that ad-hoc decisions produce fragmentation; the
cost of unifying later (which we paid in v1.0) exceeds the cost of aligning
upfront.

These principles have been in effect since v1.0 (October 2025). The v3.0 refresh
is language-only: the 10 principles themselves are unchanged, but the
descriptions are tightened for series alignment and cross-references to
downstream ADRs are added. No code migration is required. The v1.0 ADR-001
is retained in the historical archive; this v3.0 version supersedes it for all going-
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  13

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
forward citations. Engineers who have completed v1.0 onboarding do not need
re-training; the principles are identical.
TESTING STRATEGY
Principles are tested through the ADR workflow: every Proposed ADR must cite
at least one principle in its Context section, and the ARB verifies alignment
during review. Additionally, CI pipeline checks enforce principles
mechanically: P3 (security defaults) via SAST rules that fail builds on missing
auth annotations; P4 (observability) via deploy-time checks for log/metric/trace
emission; P7 (contracts) via PR checks that block implementation before spec
merge. P5 (simplicity) is tested through code review with a rubric. Principle
alignment is reported quarterly in the architecture scorecard.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Principle adherence is monitored via the architecture scorecard, published
quarterly. Metrics tracked: (a) percentage of ADRs citing each principle
(target: P1-P4 cited by >80% of relevant ADRs); (b) CI pipeline block rate for
principle violations (target: trending down as teams internalise); (c) ARB
review time per ADR (target: stable, indicating enforcement is not a
bottleneck); (d) onboarding survey scores on principle clarity (target: >4/5).
Anomalies in any metric trigger a review of the principle or its enforcement
mechanism.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The 10 principles should be revisited annually. Triggers for supersession: (a) a
principle consistently fails to resolve real disputes (indicating it is too abstract
or too narrow); (b) a new architectural concern emerges that no principle
covers (e.g., if PreOne adopts ML inference, a principle on model governance
may be needed); (c) a principle is consistently cited but never enforced
(indicating it is aspirational, not operational). The likely successor to this ADR
is a v4.0 that may add 1-2 principles (e.g., for AI/ML governance) without
removing existing ones — principles are additive because removing one would
invalidate every ADR that cites it.

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
CONTEXT
When PreOne launched in 2024, the engineering team was 8 engineers building
a single monolith in Spring Boot. By mid-2025, the team had grown to 40
engineers and the monolith was showing strain: deploy times exceeded 15
minutes, merge conflicts were frequent, and the codebase had 200k LOC with
no clear module boundaries. The team considered migrating to microservices.
A 6-week evaluation studied the trade-offs. The team found that PreOne's traffic
(peak ~5,000 requests/second) did not justify the operational overhead of
microservices. The team's DevOps capacity (2 engineers) could not support
20+ services. The business domain — preschool operations — is highly coupled
(enrollment touches billing, attendance, reporting, notifications), and a
distributed system would require complex saga orchestration for transactions
that are currently single-process. The evaluation concluded that the pain
points (deploy time, merge conflicts) were caused by the absence of module
boundaries, not by the monolith topology. The decision was to keep a single
deployable but enforce strict module boundaries — a modular monolith.
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary driver is operational efficiency: a modular monolith requires 1
deployment pipeline, 1 monitoring dashboard, 1 on-call rotation, and 1 CI/CD
infrastructure. At PreOne's scale (40 engineers, 5,000 RPS), microservices
would multiply operational cost by 5-10x without proportional business benefit.
The team can ship features faster because cross-module refactoring is a single-
PR operation, not a multi-service coordinated migration. The secondary driver
is transactional integrity: PreOne's core workflows (enrollment, fee collection,
attendance) span multiple domain modules and require ACID transactions. In a
distributed system, these would require sagas with compensating transactions
— a 10x implementation cost and a class of failure modes (partial completion,
compensation failure) that does not exist in a monolith. The tertiary driver is
debugging: a single stack trace from log to database is faster to diagnose than
tracing across 5 services.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The PreOne codebase has grown to 200k LOC without enforced module
boundaries, causing deploy-time strain and merge conflicts. We must decide
between migrating to microservices (distributed, operationally expensive) or
enforcing module boundaries within the existing monolith (centralised,
operationally lean).
CONSTRAINTS
● Engineering team size: 40 engineers (current), 150 (3-year target)
● DevOps capacity: 2 engineers (current), 5 (3-year target)
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 17

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
● Peak traffic: 5,000 RPS (current), projected 25,000 RPS at 5,000
schools
● Core workflows require ACID transactions across domain modules
● Deployment must complete in under 5 minutes (current: 15 minutes —
separate optimisation)
● AWS infrastructure budget constraints — microservices would 3x the
infra cost
ASSUMPTIONS
● Traffic growth will be roughly linear with school count (no viral spike
expected)
● The business domain will remain coupled — enrollment will continue to
touch billing, attendance, etc.
● DevOps capacity will grow slower than engineering capacity
● Module boundaries can be enforced through tooling (ArchUnit,
dependency analysis)
● The team will maintain discipline on boundary enforcement (no
shortcuts)

DECISION
ADOPTED
We adopt a modular monolith architecture. The PreOne platform is a single
Spring Boot application deployed as a single container image, with internal
module boundaries enforced through Java package-level access (module-
info.java), ArchUnit dependency rules (ADR-007), and a strict module API
contract. Each module exposes a public API package and hides its internal
implementation. Cross-module access is permitted only through the public
API. The monolith is deployed with multiple replicas behind a load balancer
for high availability (ADR-125) and horizontal scaling (ADR-126).
DETAILED RATIONALE
The modular monolith was chosen because PreOne's pain points were
boundary-related,  not  topology-related.  A 200k LOC  codebase  with no
boundaries is painful regardless of whether it is one process or twenty.
Conversely, a 200k LOC codebase with strict boundaries is maintainable in a
single process. The evaluation showed that the team's pain would reduce 80%
from boundary enforcement alone, with zero operational overhead.   The
decision preserves ACID transactions for core workflows. Enrollment (create
enrollment record, charge fee, send confirmation, update attendance roster) is
currently a single transaction across 4 modules. In a microservices topology,
this would require a saga with 4 compensating actions and a new class of failure
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  19

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
(what if the confirmation email is sent but the fee charge is rolled back?). The
business cost of partial-enrollment failures — a parent who paid but has no
enrollment, or an enrollment with no fee — is high enough that the
architectural complexity of sagas is not justified at current scale. The scaling
ceiling is the most-cited counter-argument. The analysis shows PreOne's peak
traffic (5,000 RPS) is well within a single Spring Boot instance's capacity
(typically 10,000-20,000 RPS with optimised JVM settings). At 25,000 RPS
projected peak (5,000 schools), 3-5 replicas suffice — horizontal scaling is a
solved problem. The ceiling where microservices become necessary is around
100,000 RPS, which PreOne will not reach in the 5-year horizon. The team-
discipline concern is real but manageable. ArchUnit tests run in CI and fail the
build on boundary violations. The module-info.java declaration is checked at
compile time. Engineers cannot accidentally cross boundaries — they must
explicitly open a module's API. The discipline is enforced mechanically, not
through vigilance.

DATABASE IMPACT
The modular monolith uses a single PostgreSQL database (ADR-041) shared
across all modules. Each module owns its tables (prefixed with module name,
e.g., enr_enrollments, bill_charges, att_attendance). Cross-module foreign keys
are forbidden — modules reference each other by UUID only, never by FK. This
preserves module boundaries at the data layer: a module can be extracted to a
separate database in the future without FK migration. The schema is managed
by Flyway (ADR-057) with per-module migration files. Read replicas (ADR-041)
serve reporting queries to avoid contending with write traffic.
API IMPACT
The modular monolith exposes a single REST API surface (ADR-091) with per-
module path prefixes (/api/v1/enrollments, /api/v1/billing, etc.). Internally,
modules communicate via in-process method calls through public API
interfaces, not via HTTP. This means internal calls have zero network overhead
and full transactional participation. The public REST API is the only external
surface; internal module APIs are not network-accessible. Versioning
(ADR-092) applies only to the public API; internal APIs can change freely as
long as both sides are updated in the same deploy.
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 21

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
UI IMPACT
The UI is a single React SPA (ADR-131) that calls the monolith's REST API.
From the UI's perspective, the modular monolith is indistinguishable from a
microservices backend — it sees one API host with multiple path prefixes. The
UI does not need to know about module boundaries. Loading states, error
handling, and offline support (ADR-142) are implemented uniformly across all
API calls.
SECURITY IMPACT
The modular monolith simplifies security because there is a single trust
boundary (the API gateway) and no internal service-to-service authentication.
Internal module calls are fully trusted (same process, same JVM). This
eliminates an entire class of security concerns (service-to-service auth, mTLS,
internal token propagation) that microservices must address. However, it
concentrates risk: a single RCE vulnerability compromises all modules. This is
mitigated by defence-in-depth (input validation at every module boundary,
output encoding at every API response, sandboxed file processing).
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
The modular monolith is significantly faster than a microservices equivalent for
cross-module workflows. A typical enrollment flow (4 module calls) completes
in ~5ms in-process, versus ~50ms if each call were a network hop. The
performance ceiling is the single JVM's throughput, which is typically 10,000-
20,000 RPS for I/O-bound workloads. At PreOne's projected peak of 25,000
RPS, 3-5 replicas suffice. JVM warmup is a known cost (~30 seconds for peak
performance); this is mitigated by gradual traffic shifting in the deployment
pipeline (ADR-018).
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
Horizontal scaling is the primary scaling mechanism: add more replicas behind
the load balancer (ADR-126). Each replica is stateless (session state in Redis,
ADR-073), so scaling is linear up to the database connection pool limit (~100
replicas at current PostgreSQL max_connections=1000 with 10 connections
per replica). Beyond 100 replicas, connection pooling (PgBouncer) extends the
ceiling to ~500 replicas. Vertical scaling (larger JVM heap, more CPU) is the
secondary mechanism. The true ceiling is the database — PostgreSQL single-
instance throughput is ~50,000 writes/second, which PreOne will not approach
in the 5-year horizon.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Operations are simpler than microservices: 1 deployment pipeline, 1 container
image, 1 health check endpoint, 1 monitoring dashboard. Deployments use
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 22

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
blue-green strategy (ADR-018) with 30-second traffic shifting. Rollback is a
single image swap. On-call engineers debug a single process — stack traces are
complete, no distributed tracing required for internal calls. The main
operational risk is the 'noisy neighbour' problem: a CPU-intensive operation in
one module (e.g., report generation) can starve other modules. This is
mitigated by separate thread pools per module and by offloading heavy work to
background jobs (ADR-112).

5x lower infra cost than microservices No technology diversity (locked to
Java/Spring)
REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
Microservices were rejected because the operational overhead (5-10x) is not
justified at PreOne's scale (5,000 RPS, 40 engineers). The team evaluated the
'team size per service' heuristic (Amazon's 2-pizza rule) and found that with 40
engineers, microservices would yield 4-5 services — too few to justify the
overhead and too many to be a true monolith. The hybrid option (monolith core
+ microservices for notifications/reporting) was deferred to Phase 6/7
evaluation, not rejected outright; if notifications or reporting modules grow to
require independent scaling, they can be extracted later because module
boundaries are already enforced. The service-based option was rejected as a
marginal benefit over modular monolith — the boundary ambiguity (which
service owns this?) and the distributed transaction cost outweighed the
deployment independence.
MIGRATION PLAN
No migration required — PreOne is already a monolith. The v1.0 work (Q4
2025) was to enforce module boundaries on the existing codebase: introducing
module-info.java declarations, refactoring cross-module calls to go through
public API packages, and adding ArchUnit tests. This work is complete. The
v3.0 refresh adds the in-process event bus (ADR-027) and the transactional
outbox (ADR-104) to enable future extraction if needed. If a module is extracted
to a separate service in the future, the extraction is a mechanical refactor:
replace in-process method calls with HTTP/gRPC calls, replace local
transactions with sagas. The module boundaries are already correct; extraction
changes the transport, not the structure.
TESTING STRATEGY
Module boundaries are tested via ArchUnit (unit-level: dependency rules),
integration tests (cross-module API contracts), and end-to-end tests (user
workflows). The test pyramid (ADR-146) applies: ~70% unit tests within
modules, ~20% integration tests across module APIs, ~10% E2E tests.
Contract tests (ADR-149) verify that module public APIs match their
consumers' expectations. Performance tests (ADR-150) verify that the monolith
meets latency targets under load. Boundary integrity is tested daily via CI

PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 24

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
The monolith emits structured logs (JSON, ADR-119), Prometheus metrics
(ADR-121), and OpenTelemetry traces (ADR-122). Per-module dashboards
show request rate, latency, error rate, and resource usage (CPU, memory,
thread pool). Alerts fire on: module error rate >1%, module latency p99
>500ms, JVM heap >80%, GC pause >200ms. A single Grafana dashboard
shows all modules side-by-side for quick comparison. The noisy-neighbour risk
is monitored via per-module CPU/mem metrics — if one module consistently
dominates, it triggers an evaluation for extraction.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The modular monolith is the right choice for PreOne's current and 5-year
horizon. The trigger for re-evaluation is sustained traffic exceeding 50,000 RPS
or a single module consuming >50% of resources. The likely evolution is partial
extraction: notifications (already a separate module) may extract to a separate
service first (it is async, no transactional coupling). Reporting may extract to a
separate read-optimized service (ADR-060). Core transactional modules
(enrollment, billing, attendance) will remain in the monolith indefinitely
because ACID transactions are too valuable to give up. This evolution path is
captured in ADR-002 v2.0 when triggered.

DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Adopt Clean Architecture (Robert C. Martin) as the internal structural
pattern for every module in the PreOne modular monolith. Each module is
organised into concentric layers — Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API
— with dependencies pointing inward toward the Domain.

CONTEXT
Before v1.0, the PreOne codebase used a traditional Spring MVC layering:
controllers called services, services called repositories, repositories called JPA
entities. This 'N-tier' approach worked but had a persistent problem: business
logic leaked into controllers (validation, authorisation) and into repositories
(filtering, sorting). When business rules changed, engineers had to modify code
across all three layers, and tests had to mock the entire stack to verify a single
rule. The team evaluated Clean Architecture as an alternative. Clean
Architecture inverts the dependency direction: the Domain layer (business
rules, entities, value objects) depends on nothing; the Application layer (use
cases, orchestration) depends on Domain; Infrastructure (databases, external
services) depends on Application and Domain; the API layer (controllers, DTOs)
depends on Application. This means business rules can be tested without any
framework — pure JUnit, no Spring context. The evaluation showed that Clean
Architecture would increase upfront design effort per feature (define entities
and use cases before coding) but reduce maintenance cost (business rule
changes are localised to the Domain layer) and improve testability (domain
tests run in milliseconds, no Spring boot). The team accepted the trade-off.
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 27

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary driver is maintainability: PreOne's business rules change
frequently (fee structures, enrollment policies, attendance rules) but the
infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, Spring) changes rarely. Clean Architecture
isolates the volatile part (business rules) from the stable part (infrastructure),
so changes are localised. The secondary driver is testability: domain tests run in
<1ms each, enabling thousands of tests in seconds. The tertiary driver is
onboarding: new engineers can understand a module by reading its Domain
layer, without needing to understand Spring or JPA.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Business logic in the PreOne codebase is scattered across controllers, services,
and repositories, making rule changes error-prone and testing slow. We need a
structural pattern that isolates business rules from infrastructure and enables
fast, focused tests.
CONSTRAINTS
● Must work within the modular monolith (ADR-002) — each module uses
Clean Architecture internally
● Must integrate with Spring Boot 3 (cannot require a non-Spring
framework)
● Must support JPA/Hibernate for data persistence (ADR-041)
● Domain layer must be framework-agnostic (no Spring annotations in
Domain)
● Must not add more than 15% boilerplate overhead per feature
ASSUMPTIONS
● Engineers will accept the upfront design cost in exchange for long-term
maintainability
● Spring Boot 3 can support Clean Architecture without performance
issues
● JPA can be abstracted behind repository interfaces without losing
features
● The team will maintain layer discipline (no shortcuts in code review)

DECISION
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  29

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADOPTED
We adopt Clean Architecture as the internal structural pattern for every
module. Each module is organised into four layers: (1) Domain — entities,
value objects, domain services, domain events; pure Java, no framework
dependencies. (2) Application — use cases (command/query handlers),
orchestration, transaction boundaries; depends on Domain only. (3)
Infrastructure — JPA repositories, Redis clients, external API clients;
implements interfaces defined in Application or Domain. (4) API — REST
controllers, DTOs, request/response mappers; depends on Application only.
Dependencies point inward: API -> Application -> Domain; Infrastructure
-> Application -> Domain. The Domain layer depends on nothing.
DETAILED RATIONALE
Clean Architecture was chosen because it directly addresses PreOne's pain
point: business logic scattered across layers. By inverting dependencies
(Domain depends on nothing; Infrastructure depends on Domain), business
rules are forced into the Domain layer. An engineer who tries to put business
logic in a controller will find that the controller cannot access the database (it
depends on Application, not Infrastructure) — the architecture physically
prevents the anti-pattern. The testability benefit is significant. A domain test
instantiates entities and value objects directly, calls methods, and asserts
results — no Spring context, no database, no mocks. These tests run in <1ms
each. The full domain test suite for a module (typically 200-500 tests) runs in
under 5 seconds. Integration tests (Application layer with mocked
Infrastructure) run in ~50ms each. Only E2E tests (full Spring context) are slow
(~5 seconds each), and there are few of them. The overall test suite runs in
under 2 minutes, versus 15+ minutes for the old N-tier suite. The boilerplate
cost is real but manageable. A typical use case requires: a command DTO, a
handler, a domain entity method, a repository interface (in Application), a
repository implementation (in Infrastructure), and a controller. That is 6 files
per use case versus 3 in N-tier. However, the mappers and interfaces are
mechanical and can be generated by IDE templates. The 15% boilerplate
overhead is offset by the 80% reduction in test time and the localisation of
business rule changes. The most common objection is that Clean Architecture
is 'over-engineered' for simple CRUD. The response is that PreOne has few
truly simple CRUD modules — even 'create school' involves validation (unique
name, valid address), domain events (school-created), and audit logging. The
structure is justified even for simple modules because the simplicity is
preserved (the Domain layer is small) and the structure pays off when the
module grows.

+----------+ +-----------+
DATABASE IMPACT
Clean Architecture isolates the database behind repository interfaces defined
in the Application layer. The Infrastructure layer provides JPA
implementations. This means the database schema (ADR-041) is an
infrastructure concern, not a domain concern — domain entities are pure Java,
not JPA entities. The mapping between domain entities and JPA entities is
explicit (in Infrastructure). This separation allows the schema to change
without touching the Domain layer, and allows the Domain layer to be tested
without a database. The cost is double entities (domain + JPA) and explicit
mapping, but the benefit is that database refactoring is localised to
Infrastructure.
API IMPACT
The API layer depends on Application only. Controllers receive JSON, map to
command DTOs, call use case handlers, and map responses back to JSON.
Business rules are not in controllers — they are in the Domain layer, invoked by
use case handlers. This means API changes (new endpoints, versioned
responses) do not touch business logic, and business rule changes do not
necessarily change the API. The DTO-to-command mapping is explicit and
tested. This separation is enforced by ArchUnit (ADR-007): controllers cannot
import Domain classes directly.
UI IMPACT
No direct UI impact. The UI consumes the REST API; the internal Clean
Architecture is invisible to the frontend. However, the clear separation of API
DTOs from domain entities means the API contract is stable — domain
refactoring does not break the frontend because the DTO layer absorbs the
change.
SECURITY IMPACT
Clean Architecture improves security posture by centralising authorisation in
the Application layer. Use case handlers check permissions before executing —
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 32

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
controllers do not perform authorisation (they only authenticate). This means
authorisation rules are testable without HTTP context and are consistently
applied regardless of entry point (REST API, background job, internal call).
Input validation is split: syntactic validation (is the email well-formed?) in the
API layer (DTO validation); semantic validation (is this email unique?) in the
Domain layer. This prevents invalid data from reaching the domain.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
Clean Architecture adds minimal performance overhead. The DTO-to-
command-to-domain mapping is in-process and fast (~0.1ms per request). The
double-entity pattern (domain + JPA) adds a mapping step but avoids JPA's lazy-
loading pitfalls (domain entities are loaded eagerly via repository). Overall, the
architecture adds <5% to request latency versus N-tier, which is negligible
compared to database and network time. The benefit — fast tests — improves
development velocity, which is the dominant performance metric for the team.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
Clean Architecture is a structural pattern, not a scaling pattern — it does not
affect horizontal or vertical scaling. However, it enables future module
extraction (ADR-002 future evolution) because the Application layer's use case
interfaces define clean extraction boundaries. If a module is extracted to a
separate service, the use case handlers become remote calls, the repository
implementations become HTTP clients, and the Domain layer is unchanged.
This means the architecture scales with the organisation: today, modules are
in-process; tomorrow, they can be distributed without domain rework.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Clean Architecture improves operability because business rules are testable
and debuggable in isolation. A production incident that involves a business rule
can be reproduced as a unit test (given this domain state, when this method is
called, then this exception is thrown) without needing the full application
context. The clear layering also improves log granularity: Application-layer logs
capture use case execution; Domain-layer logs capture business rule
evaluations; Infrastructure-layer logs capture database/external calls. This
separation makes log analysis faster.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  34

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
N-tier was rejected because it does not enforce dependency direction —
controllers can call repositories directly, bypassing services, and business logic
accumulates wherever it is convenient in the short term. Hexagonal
Architecture was adopted as a complement (ADR-009) for modules that need
explicit port/adapter separation (e.g., modules with multiple external
integrations), but Clean Architecture is the default because its layering is more
intuitive for most engineers. DDD Lite was rejected in favour of full DDD
(ADR-004) because half-measures in DDD produce the worst of both worlds —
the terminology overhead without the structural benefit.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q4 2025) refactored all 12 modules from N-tier to Clean
Architecture. The migration was incremental: one module per sprint, with the
Domain layer extracted first (entities and value objects), then the Application
layer (use case handlers), then Infrastructure (JPA behind repository
interfaces), then API (controllers calling handlers). Each module migration took
2-3 sprints. The migration is complete. v3.0 adds no structural changes — only
documentation and cross-references.
TESTING STRATEGY
Layer-specific tests: Domain tests (pure JUnit, no Spring, <1ms each) verify
business rules; Application tests (Spring context with mocked Infrastructure,
~50ms each) verify use case orchestration; Integration tests (real PostgreSQL
via Testcontainers, ~500ms each) verify repository implementations; E2E tests
(full HTTP stack, ~5s each) verify API contracts. Coverage targets: Domain
95%+, Application 85%+, Infrastructure 70%+. ArchUnit tests verify layer
boundaries (no Domain imports from Infrastructure, no Controller imports from
Domain).
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Per-layer observability: Application-layer logs capture use case start/finish with
correlation IDs; Domain-layer logs capture business rule evaluations (decisions
made, exceptions thrown); Infrastructure-layer logs capture database queries
and external calls with latency. Metrics: use case execution count and latency
(per handler), domain event publish count (per event type), repository query
count and latency (per aggregate). Tracing: OpenTelemetry spans per layer,
enabling per-layer latency breakdown in traces.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
Clean Architecture is a stable pattern; no supersession expected. The
architecture will evolve through complements: Hexagonal Architecture
(ADR-009) for integration-heavy modules; CQRS for read-heavy modules
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 35

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
(separate read models); Event Sourcing for audit-critical aggregates. These are
additive refinements, not replacements. The Domain layer remains the anchor;
the surrounding layers adapt to module-specific needs.

Adopt Domain Driven Design (DDD) as the methodology for modelling and
implementing  the  PreOne business  domain.  DDD's tactical patterns
(aggregates, entities, value objects, domain events, repositories) are used
within the Domain layer of every module (ADR-003).

CONTEXT
PreOne's business domain is complex: schools have branches, branches have
academic years, academic years have classes, classes have enrollments,
enrollments generate fees, fees trigger payments, payments trigger receipts,
attendance is tracked per class per day, reports aggregate everything. The
relationships are non-trivial and the business rules are many (e.g., a student
cannot be enrolled in two classes in the same time slot; a fee cannot be
collected after the academic year ends; a transfer between branches requires
re-enrollment). Before v1.0, the codebase modelled these as flat JPA entities
with no behavioural methods — 'anemic domain model'. Business rules were
implemented in service classes, scattered across the codebase. The same rule
(e.g., 'cannot enroll after capacity is reached') was implemented in 3 different
services, with 3 different bugs. Tests were slow because they required full
Spring context. The team evaluated DDD as a way to bring rigour to the domain
model. DDD's tactical patterns enforce behaviour-rich entities (entities have
methods, not just getters/setters), consistency boundaries (aggregates ensure
invariants), and explicit domain events (state changes are communicated, not
queried). The strategic patterns (bounded contexts, context mapping) help
decompose the domain into manageable modules (ADR-005).
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary driver is correctness: PreOne's business rules are complex enough
that ad-hoc implementation produces bugs (double-enrollment, over-charging,
inconsistent attendance). DDD's aggregate pattern enforces consistency
boundaries — an enrollment aggregate guarantees that its internal state is
always valid (no double-enrollment within the aggregate). The secondary driver
is communication: DDD's ubiquitous language (shared vocabulary between
engineers and domain experts) reduces the translation cost between
requirements and implementation. The tertiary driver is evolution: DDD's

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
bounded contexts (ADR-005) make the domain modular, so changes in one
context (e.g., billing) do not ripple into others (e.g., attendance).
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The PreOne business domain is complex and the current anemic domain model
scatters business rules across services, producing inconsistency and bugs. We
need a methodology that enforces consistency boundaries, behaviour-rich
entities, and a shared language between engineers and domain experts.
CONSTRAINTS
● Must work within Clean Architecture (ADR-003) — DDD lives in the
Domain layer
● Must not require a separate DDD framework (use plain Java)
● Must support JPA persistence (entities are persisted, not just in-
memory)
● Ubiquitous language must align with the BRC (Business Requirement
Catalogue) terminology
● Aggregate boundaries must align with transaction boundaries
(ADR-033)
ASSUMPTIONS
● Domain experts (product managers, school operations) will participate
in modelling sessions
● Engineers will learn DDD tactical patterns (training provided)
● The domain is stable enough that aggregate boundaries will not shift
frequently
● JPA can support DDD patterns (lazy loading, embedded values,
collection mapping) without performance issues

DECISION
ADOPTED
We adopt Domain Driven Design (Eric Evans, 2003) as the methodology for
the PreOne business domain. The strategic patterns (bounded contexts,
context mapping, ubiquitous language) are used to decompose the domain
into modules (ADR-005). The tactical patterns are used within the Domain
layer   of   every   module:   aggregates   enforce   consistency   boundaries
(ADR-022); entities have identity and behaviour (ADR-023); value objects
are immutable and compared by value (ADR-024); domain services
encapsulate   cross-aggregate   logic   (ADR-025);   repositories   provide
persistence abstraction (ADR-026); domain events communicate state
changes (ADR-027). The ubiquitous language is captured in the DDD
(Domain Design Document) per bounded context and is the authoritative
vocabulary for code, tests, and documentation.
DETAILED RATIONALE
DDD was chosen because PreOne's domain complexity makes ad-hoc modelling
untenable. The school operations domain has ~15 distinct concepts (school,
branch, academic year, class, section, student, guardian, teacher, enrollment,
attendance,   fee,   payment,   receipt,   report,   notification)   with   intricate
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  40

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
relationships. Without DDD's strategic decomposition (bounded contexts), this
becomes a single 200-class model that no engineer can hold in their head. With
bounded contexts, the model is decomposed into ~12 contexts of 10-20 classes
each — manageable. The tactical patterns directly address PreOne's pain
points. The aggregate pattern (ADR-022) is the most impactful: an enrollment
aggregate contains the enrollment root, its lines (one per class), and its fee
charges. The aggregate enforces invariants: a student cannot be enrolled in
two classes with overlapping time slots; a fee charge cannot exceed the class
fee; a withdrawal requires all lines to be withdrawn first. These invariants are
enforced in the aggregate's methods, not in services — the aggregate physically
prevents invalid state. Value objects (ADR-024) eliminate an entire class of
bugs. Money is a value object (amount + currency), not a BigDecimal — you
cannot accidentally add USD to INR. AcademicYear is a value object (startDate
+ endDate), not two Date fields — you cannot accidentally set startDate after
endDate. EmailAddress is a value object (validated string), not a String — you
cannot store an invalid email. These constraints are enforced at construction,
not at use. Domain events (ADR-027) enable loose coupling between modules.
When an enrollment is created, the enrollment aggregate publishes an
EnrollmentCreated event. The billing module subscribes and creates a fee
charge. The notification module subscribes and sends a confirmation email. The
reporting module subscribes and updates its read model. The enrollment
module does not know about billing, notifications, or reporting — it just
publishes the event. This means modules can be added or removed without
modifying the enrollment aggregate. The learning curve is the main cost.
Engineers unfamiliar with DDD typically take 2-4 weeks to become productive
with the patterns. The team invested in a 3-day DDD workshop at v1.0 launch
and a 1-day refresher at v3.0. The modelling sessions with domain experts
(product managers, school operations staff) take 4-8 hours per bounded context
— a significant upfront investment that pays off in reduced rework.

DATABASE IMPACT
DDD's aggregate boundaries define the persistence unit: an aggregate is
loaded and saved as a unit (ADR-026). This means JPA entities map 1:1 to
aggregates — an Enrollment aggregate is one enrollment row plus its line rows,
loaded eagerly. This is a departure from the traditional JPA approach of lazy-
loading everything. The trade-off is: aggregates are loaded eagerly (slightly
more data per query) but consistency is guaranteed (no lazy-loading
exceptions, no N+1 queries within an aggregate). Cross-aggregate references
are by ID only (not FK), preserving aggregate boundaries at the data layer.
Each aggregate has its own table or table-set; aggregates do not share tables.
API IMPACT
DDD's ubiquitous language directly shapes the API (ADR-091). Endpoints use
domain terms (/api/v1/enrollments, not /api/v1/registrations). DTOs mirror
domain concepts (EnrollmentDTO, not RegistrationRecord). This means the
API is self-documenting to anyone who speaks the domain language — a school
administrator recognises 'enrollment' and 'withdrawal' even if they have never
seen the API. The API does not expose aggregate internals — an enrollment
PUT does not accept individual line items; it accepts domain operations (enroll,
withdraw, transfer) that the aggregate interprets. This prevents the API from
bypassing aggregate invariants.
UI IMPACT
DDD's ubiquitous language shapes the UI (ADR-131). Screens use domain
terms: 'Enroll Student' (not 'Create Registration'); 'Withdraw Enrollment' (not
'Delete Record'); 'Academic Year 2025-26' (not 'Period 1'). This reduces
cognitive load for users who already speak the domain language (school
administrators) and improves consistency between UI and API. The UI reflects
aggregate state — an enrollment screen shows the enrollment's status, lines,
and fees as a coherent unit, mirroring the aggregate's structure.
SECURITY IMPACT
DDD improves security by centralising authorisation in the Domain layer.
Aggregate methods check permissions before mutating state — e.g.,
Enrollment.withdraw() checks that the caller has the 'withdraw-enrollment'
permission. This means authorisation is enforced regardless of entry point
(REST API, background job, internal call). It also means authorisation rules are
testable as domain tests, without HTTP context. The trade-off is that permission
checks are spread across aggregate methods (not centralised in a filter), but
this is offset by testability and consistency.
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 43

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
DDD's eager aggregate loading adds modest overhead versus lazy loading. A
typical aggregate load (enrollment + 3 lines + 2 fee charges) is 1 query with 2
joins, ~5ms. The equivalent lazy-loaded approach would be 5+ queries, ~15ms,
plus the risk of N+1. Overall, DDD is faster for aggregate-level operations and
slower for cross-aggregate queries (which require explicit joins, not
navigation). The reporting module (ADR-060) uses a separate read model to
optimise cross-aggregate queries, avoiding the aggregate-load penalty for
reports.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
DDD's aggregate boundaries are the primary scaling unit. Each aggregate is
small (10-100 rows), so loading and saving is fast. Aggregates are independent
— no locks span aggregates — so concurrent writes to different aggregates do
not contend. The scaling ceiling is the number of aggregates per tenant: a large
school might have 10,000 enrollments, which is well within PostgreSQL's
capacity. Cross-aggregate queries (reports) scale via the read model
(ADR-060), not via aggregate loading. The architecture scales linearly with
school count.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
DDD's explicit domain events improve operability. When something goes wrong
(e.g., a fee charge is missing), the event log shows exactly what happened:
EnrollmentCreated was published at T, BillingReceived at T+5ms,
FeeChargeCreated at T+10ms. The event chain is auditable. Aggregate
consistency guarantees reduce operational incidents — invalid state (double-
enrollment) is prevented at the domain layer, not caught by a downstream
validation. The trade-off is that debugging aggregate logic requires
understanding DDD patterns; on-call engineers must be DDD-literate.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
Tactical DDD only was rejected because without strategic decomposition
(bounded contexts), the domain becomes a single large model — the very
problem DDD is meant to solve. Anemic domain model was rejected because it
is the current pain point being fixed. Data-focused modelling was rejected
because it inverts the proper relationship: the domain model should drive the
schema, not vice versa. CQRS was considered as a complement (not
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  45

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
alternative) and is adopted for the reporting module (ADR-060) where read-
heavy workloads justify separate read models.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q3-Q4 2025) modelled all 12 bounded contexts with
domain experts. Each context got a DDD document (upstream of the ADR)
defining aggregates, entities, value objects, and events. The codebase was
refactored from anemic entities to behaviour-rich aggregates over 4 sprints.
The migration is complete. v3.0 adds no structural changes — only
documentation and cross-references to the new template sections.
TESTING STRATEGY
Domain tests are the core of DDD testing. Each aggregate has a test suite
covering: invariant enforcement (attempt invalid state, assert exception),
behaviour (call method, assert state change), and event publication (call
method, assert event raised). These tests run in <1ms each (pure Java, no
Spring). Integration tests verify repository implementations (load aggregate,
modify, save, reload, assert state matches). Contract tests verify domain event
consumers (billing receives EnrollmentCreated, creates FeeCharge). Coverage
target: Domain layer 95%+.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Domain events are logged with full payload (event ID, aggregate ID, timestamp,
event data). This creates an audit trail of every state change in the system.
Metrics: aggregate instance count (per type), event publish rate (per type),
invariant violation attempts (caught exceptions, indicating either a bug or a
malicious caller). Alerts fire on: invariant violation rate >0.1% (potential bug),
event publish latency >100ms (event bus issue), aggregate load latency >50ms
(potential N+1 or schema issue).
FUTURE EVOLUTION
DDD is a stable methodology; no supersession expected. The tactical patterns
may evolve: Event Sourcing for audit-critical aggregates (enrollment, billing) is
a likely future ADR. CQRS for read-heavy contexts (reporting) is already
adopted (ADR-060). Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for business rules is a
possible future addition for complex rule sets (fee calculation, promotion logic).
These are additive refinements; the DDD foundation remains.

DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Decompose the PreOne business domain into 12 explicit bounded contexts,
each owning its own ubiquitous language, aggregate roots, and persistence
tables. Contexts communicate through domain events and published APIs,
with context mapping patterns (customer-supplier, conformist, anti-
corruption layer) defining the integration topology between them.

CONTEXT
Before v1.0, the PreOne codebase had a single shared domain model: one large
package with entities like School, Branch, Student, Enrollment, Fee,
Attendance, and Notification all referencing each other directly. The model was
conceptually a 'big ball of mud' — a change to Student rippled into Enrollment,
Billing, Attendance, and Notification because every entity knew about every
other entity. Engineers could not reason about a single concern without loading
the entire model into their head, and merges between feature teams caused
persistent conflicts because every team touched the same files. The Office of
the Chief Architect initiated a strategic Domain Driven Design (DDD) exercise
in Q2 2025 to decompose this monolithic model. Over six weeks, architects and
product managers walked the entire business domain — from school
onboarding through fee collection to regulatory reporting — and identified the
natural seams where concepts had different meanings to different teams. The
canonical example was 'Student': to Enrollment, a Student is an enrollment
candidate with admission status; to Attendance, a Student is a check-in subject
with an attendance record; to Billing, a Student is a fee payer with a guardian
relationship; to Reporting, a Student is an aggregated row in a cohort report.
Same word, four different mental models. Without explicit boundaries, the
codebase tried to satisfy all four models in a single Student entity, producing an
incoherent god-object. The decomposition produced 12 bounded contexts.
Each context owns a slice of the domain, has its own ubiquitous language,
defines its own aggregate roots, and persists to its own tables (prefixed with the
context short-code). Contexts are not allowed to share JPA entities or database
tables; cross-context references use UUID identifiers only, never foreign keys.
This preserves the boundaries at both the code and data layers, making each
context independently evolvable and extractable to a separate service if scale
ever demands it (ADR-002 future evolution). The v3.0 refresh re-affirms the 12-
context split with no additions, but adds context mapping diagrams and
clarifies the customer-supplier relationships that were implicit in v1.0. The
contexts and their short-codes are: Identity (idm), Academic Structure (acs),
Student (stu), Guardian (grd), Teacher (tch), Enrollment (enr), Billing (bill),
Attendance (att), Reporting (rpt), Notification (ntf), Communication (com),
Audit (aud).
BUSINESS DRIVERS
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 49

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
The primary business driver is feature velocity at scale: PreOne's product
roadmap for 2026 contains 80+ features spanning fee restructuring, multi-
language report cards, mobile-first attendance, and DPDP Act 2023 compliance
workflows. Without bounded contexts, each feature would require coordination
across 6+ teams touching shared code; with contexts, each feature is owned by
1-2 teams working inside their own boundary. Measured benefit: average PR
cycle time dropped from 4.2 days (pre-v1.0) to 1.8 days (post-v1.0) once
contexts were enforced. The secondary driver is regulatory isolation: DPDP Act
2023 mandates that child data be handled with specific consent and retention
rules. By isolating Student, Guardian, and Communication into their own
contexts, we can apply stricter access controls, encryption, and audit logging to
those contexts without polluting the rest of the platform. The tertiary driver is
multi-tenant scale: bounded contexts map 1:1 to database table prefixes,
enabling per-context horizontal partitioning if a single context (e.g., Reporting)
outgrows the shared database.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The PreOne business domain is too large and internally inconsistent to be
modelled as a single shared domain model. We must decompose it into bounded
contexts with explicit boundaries, ubiquitous language per context, and a
defined integration topology between contexts — and we must enforce those
boundaries mechanically so they do not erode over time.
CONSTRAINTS
● Must align with the modular monolith (ADR-002) — contexts are in-
process modules, not microservices
● Must align with Clean Architecture (ADR-003) — each context has
Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API layers
● Cross-context references use UUID only, never SQL foreign keys
(preserves boundary at data layer)
● Cross-context method calls go through published API packages only
(module-info.java enforcement)
● Context boundaries must be enforceable via ArchUnit (ADR-007) in CI
● Context list must be stable enough to support a 5-year roadmap
without major restructuring
ASSUMPTIONS
● The 12 identified contexts cover all current and 5-year projected
functionality
● Domain experts will participate in per-context modelling sessions (4-8
hours each)

● Engineers will accept the discipline of crossing context boundaries only

● The in-process event bus (ADR-027) is reliable enough to be the

● Per-context table prefixes will not collide as new contexts are added

DECISION
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  52

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADOPTED
We adopt 12 bounded contexts as the strategic decomposition of the
PreOne domain: Identity (idm), Academic Structure (acs), Student (stu),
Guardian (grd), Teacher (tch), Enrollment (enr), Billing (bill), Attendance
(att), Reporting (rpt), Notification (ntf), Communication (com), Audit (aud).
Each context is implemented as an in-process module with its own module-
info.java, its own public API package, its own JPA entities (prefixed with the
short-code), and its own Flyway migration directory. Contexts communicate
via two mechanisms: (1) synchronous calls through published API interfaces
(for query-style integrations); (2) asynchronous domain events through the
in-process event bus (for state-change propagation). Context mapping is
explicit: downstream contexts (Billing, Attendance, Reporting, Notification)
are customers of upstream contexts (Enrollment, Student, Academic
Structure) via customer-supplier relationships; cross-context integration
with external systems (e.g., payment gateways, SMS providers) uses Anti-
Corruption Layers (ACLs); read-only contexts (Reporting) are conformist to
the upstream event schemas.
DETAILED RATIONALE
The 12-context split was chosen because it maps cleanly to the natural seams in
PreOne's business domain. Each context corresponds to a distinct business
capability that a school administrator would recognise as a separate concern:
'who is this person?' (Identity), 'what is the school's structure?' (Academic
Structure), 'who are the students?' (Student), 'who are the parents?'
(Guardian), 'who are the teachers?' (Teacher), 'who is enrolled in what?'
(Enrollment), 'what fees are owed?' (Billing), 'who showed up today?'
(Attendance), 'how is the school doing?' (Reporting), 'how do we reach people?'
(Notification), 'what conversations happened?' (Communication), 'what
changed and who did it?' (Audit). This capability-based decomposition ensures
contexts are stable — the capabilities of a preschool do not change even as
features within them evolve. The context mapping topology was designed to
minimise coupling. Upstream contexts (Identity, Academic Structure, Student,
Guardian, Teacher) are the source of truth for their entities and publish events
when state changes. Downstream contexts subscribe to these events and
update their own projections. For example, when a Student is created in the
Student context, it publishes StudentCreated; Enrollment subscribes and
creates an enrollment-eligible record; Notification subscribes and sends a
welcome message; Reporting subscribes and updates its student-count
projection. The Student context knows nothing about its subscribers — it just
publishes. This is the customer-supplier pattern: the supplier (Student) owns
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 53

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
the schema and publishes events; the customers (Enrollment, Notification,
Reporting) consume and adapt. The Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) pattern is
used for external integrations. The Billing context integrates with three
payment gateways (Razorpay, PayU, Cashfree) — without an ACL, each
gateway's data model would leak into Billing's domain. Instead, Billing defines
its own PaymentGateway abstraction and a per-gateway ACL that translates
gateway responses into Billing's domain model. This means switching gateways
or adding a new one is isolated to the ACL — Billing's core domain is untouched.
The conformist pattern is used for Reporting. Reporting consumes events from
every context (EnrollmentCreated, FeePaid, AttendanceRecorded, etc.) and
projects them into a read-optimised schema. Reporting is conformist because it
has no power to dictate the event schemas — it conforms to whatever upstream
publishes. If upstream changes an event schema, Reporting must adapt. This is
acceptable because Reporting is read-only and rebuilding projections is a
mechanical operation. The most likely counter-argument is that 12 contexts is
too many for a single deployable unit. The counter-counter-argument is that the
contexts are not deployed independently today (we are a modular monolith,
ADR-002), so the count of contexts does not affect operational overhead — it
affects code organisation only. The 12 contexts produce 12 modules of 10-30
classes each, which is a manageable unit of code ownership per team. If the
platform ever migrates to microservices (not before 50k RPS, per ADR-002
future evolution), the 12 contexts are already the right granularity for service
decomposition — no re-modelling needed. A second counter-argument is that
some concepts (Student, Teacher, Guardian) are 'the same entity' and should
be in one context. This is the classic DDD trap: confusing shared identity with
shared model. A Student has the same UUID across Enrollment, Attendance,
Billing, and Reporting contexts — but the model of Student in each context is
different (Enrollment cares about admission status; Attendance cares about
check-in state; Billing cares about fee liability; Reporting cares about
demographic aggregates). Sharing the model would force all four contexts to
compromise on a 'lowest common denominator' Student that satisfies none of
them well. Sharing the identity (UUID) while owning the model per context is
the correct trade-off.

DATABASE IMPACT
Each bounded context owns its own set of PostgreSQL tables, prefixed with the
context short-code: idm_users, acs_schools, acs_branches,
acs_academic_years, stu_students, grd_guardians, tch_teachers,
enr_enrollments, enr_enrollment_lines, bill_charges, bill_payments,
att_attendance, rpt_student_cohort, ntf_outbox, com_conversations,
com_messages, aud_audit_log. Cross-context foreign keys are explicitly
forbidden — a row in enr_enrollments references stu_students by student_id
(UUID column, no FK constraint), not by a SQL foreign key. This preserves
context boundaries at the data layer: a context's tables can be extracted to a
separate database without FK migration. Flyway migrations are organised per-
context (db/migration/enr/V001__create_enrollments.sql) so each context's
schema evolves independently. Per-context table prefixes also enable per-
context read replicas or per-context sharding in the future without cross-
context query impact.
API IMPACT
The public REST API surface (ADR-091) is partitioned by context:
/api/v1/identity/*, /api/v1/students/*, /api/v1/enrollments/*, /api/v1/billing/*,
/api/v1/attendance/*, /api/v1/reports/*, /api/v1/notifications/*,
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 56

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
/api/v1/communication/*. Each context owns its path prefix; cross-context
endpoints are forbidden (no /api/v1/enrollments/{id}/billing — billing for an
enrollment is accessed via /api/v1/billing?enrollmentId=X). The context prefix
is also the OpenAPI tag, so generated documentation groups endpoints by
context. Internal (in-process) cross-context calls go through the public API
package of the target context (a Java interface, not an HTTP call), so the public
API surface is the same for external and internal consumers — only the
transport differs.
UI IMPACT
The UI (React SPA, ADR-131) is organised into feature modules that mirror the
bounded contexts: a Student feature module, an Enrollment feature module, a
Billing feature module, etc. Each UI feature module owns its own routes,
components, and API client code, and consumes other contexts' data via their
REST API only. The UI does not know about the bounded context boundaries
explicitly — it just sees path prefixes — but the organisation of UI code mirrors
the backend contexts, which simplifies ownership (the Student UI feature
module is owned by the same team that owns the Student backend context).
This alignment reduces cross-team coordination overhead for end-to-end
feature delivery.
SECURITY IMPACT
Bounded contexts enable granular access control. Each context has its own
permission scope: 'student:read', 'student:write', 'billing:write',
'attendance:read', etc. A role can be granted access to specific contexts without
granting access to the whole platform — for example, a 'Teacher' role has
'attendance:write' and 'communication:read' but not 'billing:write' or
'student:delete'. This least-privilege model is enforced at the API gateway (per-
context authorisation filters) and re-validated at the use case handler level
(defence in depth). The Student, Guardian, and Communication contexts —
which hold child data subject to DPDP Act 2023 — have additional controls:
field-level encryption (ADR-076), mandatory audit logging (ADR-048), and
stricter retention rules enforced via per-context scheduled jobs.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
Bounded contexts add minimal performance overhead in a modular monolith.
Cross-context method calls through the public API package are in-process and
complete in microseconds; cross-context events through the in-process event
bus add ~1-2ms latency. The main performance consideration is event fan-out:
a single StudentCreated event is delivered to 4-5 subscriber contexts
synchronously (within the publishing transaction). To prevent slow subscribers
from blocking the publisher, the event bus delivers events through an async
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 57

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
dispatcher with a transactional outbox (ADR-104) — the publisher writes the
event to its outbox table within the transaction, and a background dispatcher
delivers to subscribers asynchronously. This decouples publisher latency from
subscriber latency.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
At 10x scale (500 schools, 50k RPS), bounded contexts scale linearly because
each context's tables and code are independent — no contention between
contexts at the database or JVM level. At 100x scale (5,000 schools, 500k RPS),
the Reporting context becomes the bottleneck because it consumes events from
all other contexts. The architecture supports extracting Reporting to a separate
service (it is already conformist and read-only) without changing any other
context — the event bus becomes a real message queue (Kafka, ADR-028 future
evolution) and Reporting consumes from it. The Enrollment, Billing, and
Attendance contexts — the transactional core — remain in the monolith
indefinitely because their cross-context transactions are too valuable to
distribute. The bounded context decomposition is thus the architectural
enabler for selective scaling: extract only what needs scaling, leave the rest in
place.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Bounded contexts improve operability by localising incidents. A bug in the
Billing context affects billing only — it does not break enrollment or attendance.
Per-context dashboards in Grafana show error rate, latency, and throughput
per context, so on-call engineers can immediately identify which context is
misbehaving. Per-context deployment is not possible (modular monolith), but
per-context feature flags are — a buggy feature can be disabled in one context
without affecting others. The trade-off is that debugging cross-context flows
requires tracing event chains: an EnrollmentCreated event that fails to trigger
a FeeCharge in Billing requires checking the event bus delivery log, the Billing
subscriber log, and the Billing use case log. OpenTelemetry traces (ADR-122)
span the full event chain, making this traceable but not trivial.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
The 6-context option was rejected because coarse contexts became god-
contexts in our prototype: merging Student + Guardian + Teacher into a single
'People' context produced a 100+ class module with no clear ubiquitous
language — the term 'Person' was ambiguous between admission, contact, and
employment senses. The 20+ context option was rejected because the context
map became a tangled graph: tracing an enrollment event through 20 contexts
in a sequence diagram was harder than reading the original big ball of mud.
The single-shared-model option was rejected because it is the pre-v1.0 problem
being solved — we measured 4.2-day average PR cycle time and 30% merge-
conflict rate in the shared model, both of which were unacceptable for the 5-
year growth plan. The 12-context split is the Goldilocks zone: small enough to
reason about, large enough to be cohesive.

MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q3-Q4 2025) decomposed the existing monolithic domain
model into 12 contexts over 4 sprints. The migration was incremental: each
sprint extracted 3 contexts, starting with the most upstream (Identity,
Academic Structure, Student) and ending with the most downstream
(Reporting, Audit). For each context extraction, the team (a) ran a modelling
session with domain experts to define the ubiquitous language and aggregate
roots, (b) moved the relevant entities and services into the new context's
package, (c) replaced direct cross-context references with calls through the
new public API package, (d) replaced synchronous cross-context state reads
with event subscriptions where possible, and (e) added ArchUnit tests to
enforce the new boundary. The migration was completed in December 2025
with zero downtime (the modular monolith was deployed continuously
throughout). v3.0 adds no new contexts; it only adds the context mapping
diagrams and clarifies the customer-supplier relationships that were implicit in
v1.0. Rollback plan: if a context boundary proves unworkable, the contexts can
be re-merged mechanically (the boundaries are package-level, not deployment-
level) — but this has not been needed and is not anticipated.
TESTING STRATEGY
Per-context test suites: each context has its own unit tests (domain layer, 95%+
coverage), integration tests (application layer with mocked infrastructure), and
contract tests (public API package). Cross-context integration is tested via
event contract tests (ADR-149): for each published event, every subscriber has
a contract test verifying it can deserialize and handle the event correctly. End-
to-end tests verify cross-context workflows (e.g., create student -> enroll -> bill
-> pay -> generate receipt) with the full event chain. ArchUnit tests in CI verify
that no context imports another context's internal packages — only the public
API package is allowed. Per-context test coverage is reported in the
architecture scorecard quarterly.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Per-context dashboards in Grafana show: request rate, latency (p50, p95, p99),
error rate, event publish rate, event consumption lag, and resource usage
(CPU, memory, DB connections). Each context has its own alert rules: error
rate >1%, latency p99 >500ms, event consumption lag >5s. OpenTelemetry
traces (ADR-122) span cross-context event chains, so an engineer can trace an
EnrollmentCreated event from publication through to all subscriber deliveries.
A dedicated 'context map health' dashboard shows the event flow between
contexts, highlighting any blocked or slow event paths. Per-context audit logs
(ADR-048) capture every state-changing operation, with the context name as a
top-level field for filtering.

FUTURE EVOLUTION
The 12-context list should be revisited annually. Triggers for adding a context:
(a) a new business capability emerges that does not fit any existing context
(e.g., if PreOne adds transport management, a Transport context may be
needed); (b) an existing context grows beyond ~50 classes, indicating it should
be split. Triggers for extracting a context to a separate service: (a) sustained
traffic from one context exceeds 20% of total platform traffic; (b) a context has
different scaling or availability requirements (e.g., Reporting may extract for
batch-friendly scaling). The likely evolution is: Reporting extracts to a separate
service by 2028 (when 5,000 schools generate report load that justifies
isolation); Notification may extract if push-notification volume exceeds in-proc
bus capacity. The other 10 contexts will remain in the monolith for the
foreseeable future because their cross-context transactions are too valuable to
distribute.

DECISION
Adopt a four-layer architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)
inside every bounded context, with explicit rules for what each layer may
import, what each layer may contain, and what is forbidden. Layers are
enforced mechanically via ArchUnit tests in CI, with package naming
conventions that make violations visually obvious in code review.

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
CONTEXT
Clean Architecture (ADR-003) defines the four concentric layers — Domain,
Application, Infrastructure, API — but does not by itself prescribe the detailed
rules: which packages each layer may import, which annotations are permitted
in each layer, where transaction boundaries live, where DTOs are defined,
where Spring annotations are allowed. Without these rules, engineers in the
pre-v1.0 codebase interpreted 'Clean Architecture' loosely: some put
@Transactional on controllers, some put JPA annotations on domain entities,
some imported Spring's ApplicationContext into the Domain layer 'just for one
utility'. The result was a 'Clean-ish Architecture' that had the vocabulary of
Clean Architecture without the discipline. This ADR closes that gap by defining
explicit, mechanically-enforced rules for each layer. The rules are written to be
testable: each rule has a corresponding ArchUnit test that fails the build on
violation. The rules cover three dimensions: (1) import rules — what each layer
may import from other layers and from external libraries; (2) content rules —
what kinds of classes (entities, controllers, repositories) may live in each layer;
(3) annotation rules — which annotations (Spring, JPA, validation) are
permitted in each layer. The v3.0 refresh adds an enforcement matrix (a table
mapping each rule to its ArchUnit test) and an exception process: any deviation
from the rules requires an ADR that justifies the exception and is approved by
the ARB. The exception ADR must specify a sunset date by which the exception
is removed or formalised. This prevents rules from eroding through
accumulated 'just this once' exceptions.
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary business driver is maintainability at scale: with 40 engineers
(growing to 150) writing code across 12 bounded contexts, consistent layering
is the difference between a codebase any engineer can pick up and one that
requires tribal knowledge per module. Measured benefit: onboarding time for a
new engineer to make their first production PR dropped from 3.5 weeks (pre-
v1.0, no enforced layering) to 1.5 weeks (post-v1.0, enforced layering) because
the rules make the code structure predictable. The secondary driver is
testability: the Domain layer has zero framework dependencies, so domain
tests run in <1ms each and require no Spring context. This enables thousands
of domain tests to run in seconds, which in turn enables aggressive refactoring
with confidence. The tertiary driver is technology migration: if Spring Boot is
ever replaced (unlikely but possible), only the Infrastructure and API layers
need to change — the Domain and Application layers are framework-agnostic
and survive the migration intact.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 65

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
Clean Architecture (ADR-003) defines four layers but does not prescribe the
detailed import, content, and annotation rules per layer. Without explicit rules,
engineers interpret 'Clean Architecture' loosely, producing inconsistent
layering that defeats the testability and maintainability benefits. We need a
mechanically-enforced rule set per layer.
CONSTRAINTS
● Rules must be enforceable via ArchUnit tests in CI (no rule that
requires human vigilance)
● Rules must be expressible in package naming conventions (violations
visually obvious in code review)
● Domain layer must be 100% framework-agnostic (no Spring, no JPA, no
Jakarta annotations)
● Rules must allow pragmatic exceptions (e.g., a domain event may
implement a marker interface from a library) via the ADR exception
process
● Rules must not require more than 5% boilerplate overhead per feature
beyond baseline Clean Architecture
ASSUMPTIONS
● Engineers will accept the discipline of layer-specific imports and
annotations
● ArchUnit can express all the rules (it can — verified via prototype)
● Spring Boot 3 and JPA/Hibernate can be confined to Infrastructure and
API layers without losing functionality
● The 4-layer model is sufficient for all 12 bounded contexts (no context
needs a 5th layer)
● Exception process will be used sparingly (<5% of classes) and not
become a loophole

DECISION
ADOPTED
We adopt a strict four-layer architecture inside every bounded context, with
the following rules. (1) Domain layer (package: <context>.domain) —
contains entities, value objects, aggregate roots, domain services, domain
events; may import only java.*, javax.* (where applicable), and other
domain packages within the same context; forbidden imports: Spring, JPA,
Jakarta EE, any infrastructure library. (2) Application layer (package:
<context>.application) — contains use case handlers (command and
query), command DTOs, query DTOs, port interfaces (repository interfaces,
event publisher interfaces); may import Domain layer and standard Java;
forbidden imports: Spring framework (except @Service, @Transactional on
handler classes), JPA, HTTP, any infrastructure library. (3) Infrastructure
layer (package: <context>.infrastructure) — contains JPA entities, JPA
repositories, Redis clients, external API clients, ACL implementations; may
import Application (port interfaces only), Domain (for mapping), Spring
Data JPA, Redis, HTTP clients; forbidden imports: API layer. (4) API layer
(package: <context>.api) — contains REST controllers, request/response
DTOs, exception handlers; may import Application layer (use case handlers,
command DTOs), Spring Web; forbidden imports: Domain layer (controllers
cannot touch domain entities directly), Infrastructure layer. Cross-context
imports are allowed only through the target context's public API package
(ADR-005).
DETAILED RATIONALE
The four-layer model was chosen because it is the smallest set of layers that
achieves framework-agnostic domain logic. With three layers (merged Domain
+ Application), business logic and orchestration mix — a use case handler that
calls entity methods and also constructs JPA queries has two reasons to change
(business rules change, data access changes), violating Single Responsibility.
With five layers (added Interface/Adapter), the additional layer adds boilerplate
without adding separation that the API layer does not already provide. The four-
layer model is the Goldilocks point: each layer has one responsibility (Domain =
business rules; Application = orchestration; Infrastructure = external systems;
API = transport). The import rules are the heart of this ADR. The Domain
layer's import restriction is the most important: if Domain cannot import
Spring, JPA, or Jakarta, then domain logic cannot accidentally become
framework-coupled. This is enforced mechanically by ArchUnit: a test that
scans all classes in *.domain.* packages and asserts none import
org.springframework.*, jakarta.persistence.*, or any infrastructure library.
This test fails the build on the first violation, so the rule cannot erode through
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 68

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
oversight. The Application layer may import Spring's @Service and
@Transactional (because handlers are Spring beans and use Spring's
transaction management) but may not import Spring Web, JPA, or HTTP —
these belong in Infrastructure or API. The Infrastructure layer may import
anything (it is the layer that talks to external systems). The API layer may
import Spring Web but not Domain — controllers receive DTOs, call use case
handlers, and return DTOs; they never see domain entities directly. This forces
the DTO-to-domain mapping to happen in the Application layer (in the use case
handler), not in the controller, which keeps controllers thin and testable. The
content rules are enforced by ArchUnit class-type assertions: classes in
*.domain.* must be in a fixed set of types (Entity, ValueObject, AggregateRoot,
DomainService, DomainEvent); classes in *.api.* must be Controller or
ExceptionHandler; classes in *.infrastructure.* must be Repository, Gateway,
Client, or Adapter. A class that does not match the expected type for its package
fails the build. This prevents, for example, a controller being placed in the
application package or a JPA entity being placed in the domain package. The
annotation rules are enforced by ArchUnit annotation-scanning tests: @Entity,
@Table, @Column (JPA annotations) may appear only in *.infrastructure.*
packages; @RestController, @RequestMapping, @GetMapping (Spring Web)
may appear only in *.api.* packages; @Service, @Transactional may appear in
*.application.* and *.infrastructure.* but not in *.domain.*; @NotNull, @Size,
@Email (Jakarta validation) may appear in *.api.* (for request DTOs) and
*.application.* (for command DTOs) but not in *.domain.* (domain validates in
constructors and methods, not via annotations). These rules ensure that the
Domain layer remains pure Java — no annotations, no framework magic —
which is what makes domain tests fast. The most likely counter-argument is
that these rules are too strict and will slow feature delivery. The counter-
counter-argument is that the rules are an upfront investment that pays off in
maintenance: a feature takes 10% longer to write but 50% less time to maintain
(because changes are localised to one layer and tests are fast). The measured
PR cycle time (1.8 days post-v1.0 vs 4.2 days pre-v1.0) supports this — the
upfront cost is paid back within the first month of a feature's life. The exception
process is the safety valve. If a feature genuinely cannot be implemented within
the rules (e.g., a domain entity needs a JPA annotation for a legacy migration),
the engineer writes a short exception ADR that (a) describes the violation, (b)
justifies why no rule-compliant alternative exists, (c) specifies a sunset date
(max 6 months), and (d) is approved by the ARB. Exceptions are tracked in a
register and reviewed quarterly — any exception past its sunset must be
removed or formalised into a rule change. This prevents exceptions from
accumulating into rule erosion.

DATABASE IMPACT
The layering rules enforce that JPA entities live only in the Infrastructure layer.
This means domain entities and JPA entities are separate classes — a domain
entity (e.g., Enrollment in com.preone.enrollment.domain) is pure Java with
behaviour; a JPA entity (e.g., EnrollmentEntity in
com.preone.enrollment.infrastructure) is a data bag with JPA annotations for
persistence. The Infrastructure layer's repository implementation maps
between the two. This double-entity pattern adds a mapping step but isolates
the database schema from the domain model — schema changes (renaming a
column, splitting a table) are localised to Infrastructure and do not touch
Domain. Flyway migrations (ADR-057) live in the Infrastructure layer's
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 71

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
resources directory; the Domain layer has no knowledge of migrations or
schema.
API IMPACT
The API layer is the only layer that touches HTTP. Controllers receive JSON,
validate it (Jakarta validation annotations on request DTOs), map it to
Application-layer command DTOs, call use case handlers, and map responses
back to JSON. Controllers cannot import Domain classes — so a controller
cannot accidentally return a domain entity as JSON (which would expose
internal structure and create a brittle API contract). Instead, the controller
returns a response DTO that is explicitly designed for the API consumer. This
separation means API versioning (ADR-092) is localised to the API layer — a v2
response DTO can coexist with a v1 response DTO, both served by the same use
case handler. OpenAPI generation (ADR-091) scans the API layer only;
Application and Domain are invisible to the API contract.
UI IMPACT
The layering rules have indirect but meaningful UI impact. Because the API
layer is thin and DTOs are explicit, the API contract is stable and well-
documented — the UI team can rely on the OpenAPI spec as the source of truth
for what fields an endpoint accepts and returns. Because controllers cannot
leak domain entities, the UI never sees internal domain structure (e.g., it never
sees a JPA lazy-loading proxy serialised to JSON, which was a recurring pre-
v1.0 bug). The UI feature modules (ADR-131) consume the REST API; the
layering rules ensure the API is the stable contract that the UI can build against
without coupling to internal domain evolution.
SECURITY IMPACT
The layering rules improve security posture by centralising input validation and
authorisation. Input validation happens in two layers: syntactic validation (is
the email well-formed? is the date in the past?) in the API layer via Jakarta
annotations on request DTOs; semantic validation (is this email unique? is this
student already enrolled?) in the Domain layer via constructor and method
invariants. Authorisation happens in the Application layer — use case handlers
check permissions before executing, so authorisation is enforced regardless of
entry point (REST API, background job, internal call). The Infrastructure layer
never makes authorisation decisions — it is a trusted inner layer that executes
what the Application layer tells it to. This layered defence makes security bugs
harder to introduce: an engineer cannot 'forget' to validate input because the
API layer's DTO annotations are required, and cannot 'forget' to check
permissions because the handler's permission check is a required method call.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 72

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
The layering rules add a small performance overhead from DTO-to-command-
to-domain-to-JPA-entity mapping. Measured overhead: ~0.3ms per request for
the mapping chain, versus ~0.1ms for direct N-tier (controller -> service -> JPA
entity). This is negligible compared to database time (typically 5-50ms per
request). The benefit — fast domain tests (<1ms each) — improves
development velocity, which is the dominant performance metric for the team.
The layering rules also prevent performance anti-patterns: because the Domain
layer cannot use JPA lazy loading, there are no N+1 query bugs in domain code
(aggregates are loaded eagerly via repositories, ADR-026); because controllers
cannot touch the database directly, there are no 'controller runs a raw SQL
query' anti-patterns that bypass query optimisation.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
The layering rules are structural, not scaling, but they enable scaling in two
ways. First, the framework-agnostic Domain layer means the domain model can
be reused in a different deployment topology (e.g., a batch processing job that
loads aggregates without Spring context) without modification. Second, the
explicit port interfaces in the Application layer mean a context can be extracted
to a separate service (ADR-002 future evolution) by replacing the
Infrastructure layer's repository implementation with an HTTP client — the
Domain and Application layers are unchanged. At 10x scale, the layering rules
have no direct performance impact; at 100x scale, they enable selective
extraction of contexts to microservices without domain rework.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
The layering rules improve operability by making logs and traces structured by
layer. Application-layer logs capture use case execution (handler name,
command parameters, duration); Infrastructure-layer logs capture external
calls (SQL queries, Redis commands, HTTP calls with latency); Domain-layer
logs capture business rule evaluations (decisions, exceptions). This separation
makes incident diagnosis faster — an engineer can look at the Application-layer
log to see which use case failed, then drill into the Infrastructure-layer log to
see which external call caused the failure. OpenTelemetry traces (ADR-122)
span all layers, with spans named by layer (api.controller, application.handler,
infrastructure.repository), so the trace timeline shows where time is spent per
layer.

Stable API contract (controllers cannot More DTO classes (request, response,

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
The convention-only option (4 layers, no ArchUnit) was rejected because pre-
v1.0 we tried it and the layers eroded within 6 months — engineers put
@Transactional on controllers, JPA annotations on domain entities, and
Spring's ApplicationContext in domain services 'just for one utility'. Convention
without mechanical enforcement does not survive contact with deadline
pressure. The 3-layer option (merged Domain + Application) was rejected
because business logic and use case orchestration have different reasons to
change — merging them violates Single Responsibility and makes the merged
layer untestable without Spring context. The 5-layer option (separate
Interface/Adapter layer) was rejected because the API layer already serves the
interface role; adding a 5th layer doubles the boilerplate for marginal benefit.
Hexagonal Architecture (ADR-009) is adopted as a complement for integration-
heavy modules (e.g., Billing with its three payment gateways), not as a
replacement for the default 4-layer model.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q3-Q4 2025) refactored all 12 contexts to comply with the
layering rules. Each context migration was a 1-sprint effort: (a) move classes
into the correct layer packages (api, application, domain, infrastructure); (b)
introduce double entities where JPA annotations were on domain entities
(domain entity + JPA entity + mapper); (c) introduce command/query DTOs
where controllers were using domain entities directly; (d) add ArchUnit tests
for the context. The migration was completed in December 2025 with zero
downtime. v3.0 adds the enforcement matrix (mapping each rule to its
ArchUnit test) and the exception process — both are documentation-only
changes, no code migration. Rollback plan: if a rule proves unworkable for a
specific context, the context can request an exception via the ADR process; if
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 75

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
the rule proves globally wrong, this ADR is superseded by a v2.0 with the
revised rule set.
TESTING STRATEGY
Layer rules are tested via ArchUnit (com.preone.architecture.LayerRulesTest)
which scans all 12 contexts and asserts: (a) domain packages import no
framework classes; (b) application packages import no Spring Web or JPA
classes; (c) api packages import no domain or infrastructure classes; (d)
infrastructure packages import no api classes; (e) class types match their layer
(controllers in api, entities in domain, repositories in infrastructure). These
tests run in CI on every PR and fail the build on violation. Additionally, per-layer
unit tests verify layer-specific behaviour: domain tests (pure JUnit, <1ms each,
95%+ coverage); application tests (Spring context with mocked infrastructure,
~50ms each, 85%+ coverage); infrastructure tests (Testcontainers with real
PostgreSQL, ~500ms each, 70%+ coverage); API tests (MockMvc with full
Spring Web context, ~200ms each).
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Layer rule adherence is monitored via the architecture scorecard, published
quarterly. Metrics tracked: (a) ArchUnit violation count per context (target: 0);
(b) exception register size (target: <5% of classes); (c) per-layer test coverage
(target: Domain 95%+, Application 85%+, Infrastructure 70%+); (d) per-layer
test execution time (target: Domain <5s per context, Application <30s per
context). Per-layer logs are tagged with layer name (api, application, domain,
infrastructure) for structured log queries. OpenTelemetry spans are named by
layer, so trace timelines show per-layer latency breakdown. Anomalies (e.g.,
Domain layer test time >5s indicating accidental framework coupling) trigger
an architecture review.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The layering rules are stable; no supersession expected. The rules will evolve
through complements: Hexagonal Architecture (ADR-009) for integration-
heavy modules adds explicit ports and adapters within the Infrastructure layer;
CQRS for read-heavy modules (Reporting, ADR-060) adds a separate query-side
layer that bypasses the Domain layer for reads. These are additive refinements,
not replacements. The 4-layer model remains the default for all 12 contexts.
The exception process is the mechanism for evolving the rules: if multiple
exceptions are granted for the same rule, that rule is a candidate for revision in
the next v-next of this ADR.

ACCEPTED
DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Adopt the Dependency Inversion Principle as the governing rule for all
dependencies in the PreOne codebase: dependencies point inward toward
the Domain layer, never outward. Infrastructure dependencies are inverted
via port interfaces defined in the Application layer and implemented in
Infrastructure. The rule is enforced by ArchUnit tests in CI, with cycle
detection that fails builds on circular dependencies of any size.

direction
Supersedes None (v1.0 original; v3.0 adds cycle

CONTEXT
Clean Architecture (ADR-003) states that 'dependencies point inward' but does
not by itself enforce the rule. In the pre-v1.0 codebase, dependencies flowed in
every direction: controllers depended on JPA repositories directly (outward);
domain entities imported Spring's @Component annotation (outward); use case
handlers imported HttpClient for external API calls (outward, and a violation of
Clean Architecture). The result was a codebase where changing any layer could
break any other layer — a JPA migration broke controllers, a Spring upgrade
broke domain tests, an external API change broke use case handlers. The
Office of the Chief Architect defined the Dependency Rule as the mechanical
enforcement of Clean Architecture's dependency direction. The rule has three
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 79

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
parts: (1) source code dependencies point inward only — API depends on
Application, Application depends on Domain, Infrastructure depends on
Application and Domain, Domain depends on nothing; (2) infrastructure
dependencies (databases, external APIs, message brokers) are inverted via port
interfaces defined in Application or Domain and implemented in Infrastructure;
(3) no circular dependencies are permitted at any granularity (class, package,
module, context). The v3.0 refresh adds explicit inversion patterns for the
three most common infrastructure dependencies — database access
(Repository port), external HTTP APIs (Gateway port), and event publishing
(EventPublisher port) — and adds cycle detection via ArchUnit's slice rules. The
cycle detection is important because cycles can sneak in at the package level
even when class-level dependencies appear correct: package A imports
package B which imports package C which imports package A is a cycle that is
invisible in a single class but breaks modularity.
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary business driver is change isolation: PreOne's technology stack will
evolve (Spring Boot upgrades, JPA version bumps, database migrations, new
external integrations) but the domain model must remain stable because it
encodes the business rules that are the platform's competitive advantage. The
Dependency Rule ensures that infrastructure changes cannot break the domain
— the domain depends on interfaces (ports), not implementations, so swapping
a JPA repository for a JDBC repository or an HTTP client for a gRPC client is
localised to Infrastructure. Measured benefit: Spring Boot 3.1 to 3.2 upgrade
(Q1 2026) touched 0 lines of Domain code and 3 lines of Application code,
versus an estimated 500+ lines in the pre-v1.0 architecture. The secondary
driver is testability: because Domain depends on nothing, domain tests run
without Spring, JPA, or HTTP — they are pure JUnit and run in <1ms each.
Because Application depends on port interfaces, application tests mock the
ports (not the implementations) and run without real infrastructure. The
tertiary driver is onboarding: new engineers can understand a module by
reading its Domain and Application layers — the interfaces tell them what the
module does, without requiring them to understand JPA or Spring Web.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Clean Architecture (ADR-003) and Layering Rules (ADR-006) define the
intended dependency direction, but without mechanical enforcement,
dependencies flow in every direction and infrastructure changes break
unrelated layers. We need a rule that (a) enforces inward-only dependency
direction, (b) inverts infrastructure dependencies via ports, and (c) detects and
prevents circular dependencies at all granularities.

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
CONSTRAINTS
● Rule must be enforced via ArchUnit in CI (no rule that requires human
vigilance)
● Rule must cover class-level, package-level, module-level, and context-
level dependencies
● Rule must allow pragmatic infrastructure inversion (ports defined in
Application or Domain, implemented in Infrastructure)
● Cycle detection must run in <30 seconds on the full codebase (CI-
friendly)
● Rule must permit Java standard library imports in any layer (java.util,
java.time, java.math)
ASSUMPTIONS
● ArchUnit can express all dependency rules (verified via prototype,
including slice-based cycle detection)
● Engineers will accept that infrastructure dependencies require a port
interface (no direct JPA/HTTP in Application or Domain)
● The port interface pattern adds acceptable boilerplate (<10% overhead
per use case)
● Cycle detection will not produce false positives at the package level
(ArchUnit slices are accurate)
● The rule set is stable enough to support a 5-year horizon without major
restructuring

ADOPTED
We adopt the Dependency Rule as the governing dependency-direction
policy for the PreOne codebase, enforced via ArchUnit. The rule has three
parts. (1) Inward-only source dependency direction: API -> Application ->
Domain; Infrastructure -> Application -> Domain; Domain -> (nothing). No
layer may import a layer outward of itself. Cross-layer imports within the
same context follow the same rule. Cross-context imports go through the
target context's public API package only (ADR-005). (2) Infrastructure
dependency inversion: every infrastructure dependency (database, external
HTTP API, message broker, file system, cache) is accessed through a port
interface defined in the Application layer (or Domain layer for ports that are
part of the domain contract) and implemented in the Infrastructure layer.
Application and Domain code depend on the port interface, never on the
implementation. The implementation is injected via Spring's @Autowired
(constructor injection), with the implementation class annotated
@Repository, @Service, or @Component in Infrastructure. (3) Cycle
detection: ArchUnit slice rules assert that no cycles exist at the class level,
package level (within a context), and context level (between contexts).
Cycles of any size fail the build. The three canonical inversion patterns are:
Repository (port in Application, JPA impl in Infrastructure), Gateway (port
in Application, HTTP client impl in Infrastructure), EventPublisher (port in
Application, in-proc bus impl in Infrastructure).
DETAILED RATIONALE
The Dependency Rule is the mechanical backbone of Clean Architecture.
Without it, 'dependencies point inward' is an aspiration; with it, the aspiration
becomes a build-breaking fact. The rule was chosen because it directly
addresses the pre-v1.0 failure mode: every layer depended on every other layer,
and no layer could change without breaking another. By enforcing inward-only
direction, the rule ensures that the Domain layer — the most valuable, most
stable, most business-encapsulating layer — depends on nothing and can
therefore be changed, tested, and evolved without touching anything else. The
inversion pattern (port in Application, implementation in Infrastructure) is the
mechanism that makes the rule workable. Without inversion, the Application
layer would need to import Infrastructure to access the database, violating the
inward rule. With inversion, the Application layer defines a port interface (e.g.,
EnrollmentRepository with save(), findById(), delete() methods), the
Infrastructure layer provides the JPA implementation
(JpaEnrollmentRepository implements EnrollmentRepository), and Spring's
dependency injection wires the implementation into the Application layer at
runtime. The Application layer's code references only the interface — it has no

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
compile-time dependency on JPA. This means JPA can be swapped for JDBC,
MongoDB, or a remote HTTP API without touching Application code — the
change is localised to a new Infrastructure implementation. The cycle
detection is the second key component. Cycles are the silent killer of
modularity: a cycle between package A and package B means the two packages
are effectively one module — they cannot be understood, tested, or extracted
separately. Cycles sneak in because each individual class dependency looks
harmless (A.Biz uses B.Util, B.Helper uses A.Config — individually fine,
together a cycle). ArchUnit's slice rules detect cycles at the package and
context level by analysing the full dependency graph, not individual
dependencies. The build fails on any cycle, forcing engineers to break the cycle
(typically by extracting a shared dependency into a third package, or by
inverting one direction via a port interface). The most likely counter-argument
is that the port interface pattern adds unacceptable boilerplate. The counter-
counter-argument is that the boilerplate is one interface per infrastructure
dependency — typically 3-5 interfaces per context (Repository, EventPublisher,
maybe a Gateway or two). Each interface is 5-15 lines. The total boilerplate per
context is ~50-100 lines, against a context size of 1000-3000 lines — 3-5%
overhead. This is paid back in the first Spring upgrade or JPA migration: the
upgrade touches Infrastructure only, not Application or Domain. A second
counter-argument is that the rule prevents 'pragmatic' shortcuts — e.g., a
domain service that needs to call an external API to validate a GST number
must go through a port, not call the HTTP client directly. The response is that
this is a feature, not a bug: the port makes the dependency explicit, testable
(mock the port in domain tests), and replaceable (swap the GST validation
service without touching the domain). The 'shortcut' of calling the HTTP client
directly would couple the domain to a specific HTTP library and a specific
external service, making both the domain and the tests brittle. The cycle
detection has surfaced real cycles in the v1.0 migration: 12 cycles were
detected across the 12 contexts, mostly at the package level (e.g., the
enrollment.domain.events package imported enrollment.domain.aggregates
for event payload types, and enrollment.domain.aggregates imported
enrollment.domain.events to publish events — a cycle). The fix was to extract
the shared types into a third package (enrollment.domain.shared), breaking the
cycle. Without ArchUnit's slice detection, these cycles would have persisted
and made future module extraction painful.

(interface) <-- JpaRepo --> DB (Application depends on port; Infrastructure
depends on port; JPA upgrade touches only JpaRepo, not Handler)
DATABASE IMPACT
The Dependency Rule inverts the database dependency. The Application layer
defines a Repository port interface (e.g., EnrollmentRepository with save,
findById, delete methods); the Infrastructure layer provides a JPA
implementation (JpaEnrollmentRepository). The Application layer has no
compile-time dependency on JPA, Hibernate, or Spring Data JPA — only on the
port interface. This means the database technology can be swapped
(PostgreSQL to MongoDB, JPA to JDBC, single-DB to sharded-DB) by writing a
new Infrastructure implementation, without touching Application or Domain
code. The Repository port is the contract; the implementation is
interchangeable. Flyway migrations (ADR-057) live in Infrastructure's
resources and are invisible to Application and Domain.
API IMPACT
The Dependency Rule indirectly shapes the API. Because the API layer cannot
import Domain (per ADR-006), controllers cannot return domain entities
directly — they must return DTOs that are designed for the API consumer. This
forces an explicit mapping step (DTO <-> Command <-> Domain) that makes
the API contract stable: a domain entity refactoring does not break the API
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 86

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
because the DTO layer absorbs the change. The API layer also depends on
Application (not Infrastructure), so controllers do not call repositories directly
— they call use case handlers, which call repositories through ports. This means
the API layer is testable with mocked use case handlers, without any database
or JPA context.
UI IMPACT
No direct UI impact, but the Dependency Rule's effect on API stability benefits
the UI. Because the API layer depends on Application (not Domain), and
Application defines stable command/query DTOs, the API contract is insulated
from domain refactoring. The UI team can build against the OpenAPI spec
(ADR-091) with confidence that internal domain evolution will not break the
API. The UI feature modules (ADR-131) consume the REST API; the
Dependency Rule ensures the API is the stable contract that the UI can rely on
without coupling to internal domain or infrastructure changes.
SECURITY IMPACT
The Dependency Rule improves security by centralising infrastructure access
in the Infrastructure layer. All database access goes through Repository ports;
all external API calls go through Gateway ports; all event publishing goes
through EventPublisher ports. This means security controls (e.g., tenant
isolation filters in JPA queries, encryption-at-rest for sensitive fields, audit
logging for state changes) can be applied uniformly at the Infrastructure layer's
implementations, without being scattered across Application or Domain code.
The Application layer's use case handlers call ports; they do not know whether
the implementation encrypts data, logs access, or applies tenant filters — those
are Infrastructure concerns. This separation prevents security bugs that arise
from inconsistent application of controls.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
The Dependency Rule adds minimal performance overhead. The port interface
call is a virtual method dispatch (~1 nanosecond), negligible compared to
database or network time. The inversion does not add a network hop or
serialization — the implementation is in-process and injected via Spring DI. The
benefit — infrastructure changes are localised — improves development
velocity, which is the dominant performance metric. One indirect performance
benefit: because the Domain layer has no JPA lazy loading (Domain depends on
nothing, so it cannot use JPA), there are no N+1 query bugs in domain code.
Aggregates are loaded eagerly via Repository ports, which forces explicit query
design and avoids the lazy-loading performance trap.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 87

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
The Dependency Rule is structural, not scaling, but it enables scaling in two
ways. First, the port interfaces define clean extraction boundaries: if a context
is extracted to a separate service (ADR-002 future evolution), the Repository
port's JPA implementation is replaced with an HTTP client implementation, and
the Application layer is unchanged. Second, the cycle detection prevents the
dependency spaghetti that makes large codebases unmaintainable — at 10x
scale (150 engineers, 200k LOC), cycle-free code is essential for parallel
development. At 100x scale (500 engineers, 1M LOC), the Dependency Rule is
the difference between a codebase that can be reasoned about and one that
cannot.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
The Dependency Rule improves operability by making dependencies explicit. A
production incident that involves a database failure is traceable through the
Repository port — the port's implementation logs the failure, and the
Application layer's use case handler logs the port call's failure. The clear
layering makes log analysis faster: an engineer can look at the Application-layer
log to see which use case failed, then drill into the Infrastructure-layer log to
see which database call caused the failure. OpenTelemetry traces (ADR-122)
span the port boundary, with spans named by layer (application.handler,
infrastructure.repository), so the trace timeline shows where time is spent per
layer and where failures occur.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
The no-cycle-detection option (class-level inward rule only) was rejected
because pre-v1.0 we had 12 package-level cycles that were invisible at the class
level — each individual class dependency looked harmless, but the package-
level cycle made the two packages effectively one module. ArchUnit's slice
detection surfaced these cycles and forced their resolution. The layered-
without-inversion option (Application imports Infrastructure directly) was
rejected because it is the pre-v1.0 problem being solved — Application
depended on JPA, and every JPA upgrade broke Application code. The full-
Hexagonal option (explicit ports for every concern, even internal ones) was
rejected as over-engineered for the default case — the chosen option inverts
only infrastructure dependencies (database, external API, event bus), which is
the minimum inversion needed to achieve framework-agnostic domain.
Hexagonal (ADR-009) is adopted as a complement for integration-heavy
modules where additional ports (e.g., for multiple payment gateways) are
justified.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q3-Q4 2025) introduced port interfaces for all
infrastructure dependencies across all 12 contexts. For each context, the team
(a) identified all infrastructure dependencies in Application and Domain code
(direct JPA usage, direct HTTP client usage, direct event publishing); (b)
defined a port interface in Application for each dependency; (c) moved the
implementation to Infrastructure and annotated it @Repository or @Service;
(d) updated Application code to depend on the port, not the implementation; (e)
added ArchUnit rules for the context's dependency direction and cycle
detection. The migration surfaced 12 package-level cycles, all of which were
resolved by extracting shared types. The migration was completed in December
2025 with zero downtime. v3.0 adds the cycle detection slice rules (which were
not in v1.0) and the explicit inversion patterns documentation. Rollback plan: if
a port proves unnecessary, the implementation can be inlined back into
Application — but this has not been needed and would require an ADR justifying
the exception.
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 90

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
TESTING STRATEGY
Dependency rules are tested via ArchUnit
(com.preone.architecture.DependencyRulesTest) which scans all 12 contexts
and asserts: (a) Application packages import no Infrastructure packages; (b)
Domain packages import no framework classes (Spring, JPA, Jakarta); (c) API
packages import no Domain or Infrastructure packages; (d) no class-level
cycles (A -> B -> A); (e) no package-level cycles within a context (slice rule); (f)
no context-level cycles (cross-context slice rule). These tests run in CI on every
PR and fail the build on violation. Cycle detection is also run nightly on the full
codebase to catch cycles that might sneak in through merged PRs. Port
interface contracts are tested via contract tests (ADR-149): each port has a
contract test suite that every implementation must pass, ensuring that
swapping implementations does not break the contract.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Dependency rule adherence is monitored via the architecture scorecard,
published quarterly. Metrics tracked: (a) ArchUnit violation count per context
(target: 0); (b) cycle count per context (target: 0); (c) port interface count per
context (target: 3-5, indicating appropriate inversion); (d) direct-infrastructure-
import count in Application/Domain (target: 0). Per-port observability:
Repository port calls are logged with aggregate type and operation
(save/findById/delete); Gateway port calls are logged with external service and
latency; EventPublisher port calls are logged with event type and subscriber
count. OpenTelemetry spans span the port boundary, so traces show the
application.handler span calling the infrastructure.repository span, with the
port interface as the boundary marker.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The Dependency Rule is stable; no supersession expected. The rule will evolve
through complements: Hexagonal Architecture (ADR-009) for integration-
heavy modules adds additional ports for external integrations; CQRS for read-
heavy modules (ADR-060) may relax the rule for read-side repositories
(allowing direct SQL for reads, bypassing the aggregate pattern). These are
additive refinements, not replacements. The cycle detection rules may be
tightened over time (e.g., adding module-level cycle detection beyond package-
level) as the codebase grows. The likely successor to this ADR is a v2.0 that
formalises the exception process and adds automated cycle-visualisation
tooling, not a fundamental change to the rule itself.

CONTEXT
Clean Architecture (ADR-003) and the Layering Rules (ADR-006) define the
macro structure of the PreOne codebase — which layers exist, what each layer
may import, how dependencies flow. But macro structure does not by itself
produce good code within a layer. A use case handler that does 12 things, a
value object that has 30 methods, a repository interface with 25 methods, a
service class that is instantiated in 8 different ways — all of these are 'Clean
Architecture compliant' but violate SOLID principles. Without SOLID
enforcement, the macro structure is correct but the micro structure rots. Pre-
v1.0, the codebase had no SOLID enforcement. Engineers invoked SOLID in
code review discussions ('this violates SRP'), but the invocations were
subjective and inconsistent — what one engineer considered 'single

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
responsibility' another considered 'reasonable cohesion'. The result was a
codebase where SOLID was aspirational but not operational: some classes
followed SOLID rigorously, others did not, and there was no objective standard.
This ADR makes SOLID operational by defining concrete, testable rules for
each principle and the enforcement mechanism for each. Single Responsibility
is enforced via one-use-case-per-handler (ArchUnit checks that each handler
class has exactly one public method) and via method-count limits per class
(PMD checks). Open/Closed is enforced via the strategy pattern for policies
(fees, discounts, notifications) — new policies are added by implementing a
strategy interface, not by modifying existing classes. Liskov Substitution is
enforced via value object immutability and contract tests (subtypes must
honour the supertype's contract). Interface Segregation is enforced via narrow
repository interfaces (one per aggregate, not a god-repository) and via
ArchUnit checks on interface method counts. Dependency Inversion is enforced
via the Dependency Rule (ADR-007) — port interfaces in Application,
implementations in Infrastructure. The v3.0 refresh adds an enforcement
matrix mapping each SOLID principle to its concrete rule(s) and enforcement
mechanism(s), making it mechanical to verify compliance rather than
subjective.
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary business driver is maintainability at scale: PreOne's codebase will
grow from ~100k LOC (current) to ~500k LOC (5-year target) across 12
contexts. SOLID-compliant code scales linearly with size — small classes with
single responsibilities are easy to understand, test, and modify. Non-SOLID
code scales quadratically — large classes with multiple responsibilities have
O(n^2) interaction surface, making every change risky. Measured benefit:
average bug-fix PR size dropped from 180 LOC (pre-v1.0, no SOLID
enforcement) to 65 LOC (post-v1.0, SOLID enforced), indicating that bugs are
localised to small, focused classes. The secondary driver is onboarding: new
engineers can understand a SOLID-compliant codebase faster because each
class has one clear responsibility (SRP), each extension point is explicit (OCP),
and each interface is narrow (ISP). The tertiary driver is testability: SOLID-
compliant code is testable because classes have few dependencies (SRP),
dependencies are injectable (DIP), and behaviour is substitutable for testing
(LSP).
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Clean Architecture (ADR-003) and Layering Rules (ADR-006) define the macro
structure but do not enforce good micro-level design. Without SOLID
enforcement, classes within layers accumulate multiple responsibilities, grow

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
beyond comprehension, and become hard to test and modify. We need
concrete, mechanically-enforced rules for each SOLID principle.
CONSTRAINTS
● Rules must be testable (enforced via static analysis or objective code
review checklist)
● Rules must not add more than 10% boilerplate overhead per feature
● Rules must align with DDD tactical patterns (ADR-004) — SOLID at the
domain level is expressed via aggregates, value objects, repositories
● Rules must be teachable in a 2-hour onboarding session
● Rules must permit pragmatic exceptions via the ADR exception process
(ADR-006)
ASSUMPTIONS
● Engineers will accept SOLID discipline as the price of maintainable
code
● Static analysis tools (ArchUnit, PMD, Error Prone) can express the
rules (verified via prototype)
● The strategy pattern for policies (OCP) is applicable to all PreOne
policy types (fees, discounts, notifications)
● Value object immutability (LSP) is enforceable via constructor-only
initialisation and final fields
● The 5 SOLID principles collectively cover the micro-design space (no
6th principle needed)

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADOPTED
We adopt the SOLID principles as the design-level complement to Clean
Architecture, enforced through a combination of static analysis and code
review. (1) Single Responsibility (SRP): each class has one reason to
change. Enforced via: one public method per use case handler (ArchUnit);
method count <=15 per class (PMD, exception ADR required for god-
classes like mappers); one aggregate root per repository. (2) Open/Closed
(OCP): classes are open for extension, closed for modification. Enforced via:
strategy pattern for all policies (fee calculation, discount application,
notification channel selection, GST computation) — new policies are added
by implementing a strategy interface, not by modifying existing classes;
code review checklist verifies that new behaviour is added via new classes,
not by modifying existing classes. (3) Liskov Substitution (LSP): subtypes
must be substitutable for their supertypes. Enforced via: value object
immutability (final fields, constructor-only initialisation) — subtypes cannot
weaken immutability; contract tests for repository implementations —
every JPA repository impl must pass the port's contract test suite. (4)
Interface Segregation (ISP): clients should not depend on methods they do
not use. Enforced via: one repository interface per aggregate (not a god-
repository with 25 methods); ArchUnit check that no interface has >10
methods (exception ADR required for larger interfaces). (5) Dependency
Inversion (DIP): depend on abstractions, not concretions. Enforced via the
Dependency Rule (ADR-007) — Application and Domain depend on port
interfaces, not Infrastructure implementations; Spring DI injects
implementations at runtime.
DETAILED RATIONALE
SOLID was chosen because it is the smallest set of design principles that
collectively cover the micro-design space. SRP addresses class scope (one
responsibility per class); OCP addresses extension (add behaviour without
modifying existing code); LSP addresses substitution (subtypes honour
supertype contracts); ISP addresses interface scope (narrow interfaces); DIP
addresses dependency direction (depend on abstractions). Together, they
cover the five dimensions of micro-design, with minimal overlap. The principles
are well-known (Robert C. Martin, 2000), well-documented, and teachable in a
2-hour onboarding session — critical for a team scaling from 40 to 150
engineers. SRP is the most impactful and the hardest to enforce mechanically.
The proxy rule — one public method per use case handler — captures SRP for
the Application layer: a handler with one public method (execute()) has one
reason to change (the use case it implements). For other classes (domain
entities, value objects, infrastructure implementations), SRP is enforced via
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 98

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
method count limits (PMD) and code review judgement. The method-count limit
is a proxy: a class with 30 methods probably violates SRP, but a class with 10
focused methods might not. The code review checklist asks: 'Does this class
have one reason to change? If the fee calculation rules change, does this class
need to change? If the notification rules change, does this class need to change?
If both answers are yes, the class violates SRP.' OCP is enforced via the
strategy pattern, which is the canonical OCP implementation: define an
interface for a policy, implement the interface for each variant, and select the
variant at runtime via configuration or input. PreOne has several policy
domains: fee calculation (per-term, monthly, one-time), discount application
(sibling, early-bird, scholarship), notification channel (SMS, email, push,
WhatsApp), GST computation (per state, per service type). Each policy domain
has a strategy interface (FeeCalculator, DiscountApplier, NotificationChannel,
GstComputer) and multiple implementations. Adding a new fee structure (e.g.,
quarterly billing) is a new FeeCalculator implementation, not a modification of
an existing one. This means new policies can be added without risking
regressions in existing policies — the existing classes are closed for
modification. LSP is enforced via value object immutability and contract tests.
Value objects (Money, EmailAddress, AcademicYear, etc.) are immutable: final
fields, constructor-only initialisation, no setters. A subtype of a value object
cannot weaken immutability — if Money is immutable, INR and USD (subtypes)
must also be immutable. Contract tests verify that repository implementations
honour the port's contract: if the port says findById() returns
Optional<Enrollment> and throws on null ID, every implementation (JPA, in-
memory test double) must do the same. A subtype that returns null instead of
Optional, or that silently accepts a null ID, violates LSP and fails the contract
test. ISP is enforced via narrow repository interfaces. Pre-v1.0, the codebase
had a god-repository pattern: one EnrollmentRepository interface with 25
methods (save, findById, findAll, findByStudentId, findByClassId, findByStatus,
findByDateRange, countByClass, averageFee, etc.). Different consumers
needed different subsets — the enrollment handler needed save and findById;
the reporting projection needed findByStudentId and countByClass; the
notification subscriber needed findById only. With ISP, the interface is split:
EnrollmentRepository (save, findById, delete — for the enrollment handler),
EnrollmentQueryPort (findByStudentId, findByClassId, findByStatus,
countByClass — for the reporting projection), EnrollmentReadModel
(averageFee, cohortStats — for reporting). Each consumer depends only on the
interface it uses. ArchUnit checks that no interface has >10 methods,
preventing god-interfaces from re-emerging. DIP is enforced via the
Dependency Rule (ADR-007) and is the most mechanically enforced of the five.
Application and Domain depend on port interfaces; Infrastructure provides
implementations; Spring DI wires them. An ArchUnit rule asserts that no
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 99

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
Application or Domain class imports an Infrastructure class — a single violation
fails the build. This makes DIP a build-breaking fact, not an aspiration. The
most likely counter-argument is that SOLID produces too many small classes
(boilerplate). The counter-counter-argument is that small classes are the point
— a class with one responsibility is easy to understand, test, and modify. The
boilerplate cost (more files, more interfaces, more mappers) is offset by the
maintenance savings (changes are localised, tests are fast, bugs are small).
Measured: SOLID-compliant code has ~15% more files than non-SOLID code,
but ~50% lower bug rate and ~40% faster PR cycle time.

DATABASE IMPACT
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 101

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
SOLID has indirect database impact through the Repository pattern (DIP) and
aggregate design (SRP). Each aggregate has its own Repository port (ISP:
narrow interface, ~3-5 methods), implemented in Infrastructure as a JPA
repository. This means database access is per-aggregate, not per-table — a
single aggregate may map to multiple tables (e.g., Enrollment aggregate maps
to enr_enrollments and enr_enrollment_lines), but the Repository port hides
this from the Application layer. Schema changes (adding a column, splitting a
table) are localised to the Infrastructure layer's repository implementation and
mapper; the Domain and Application layers are unchanged. The strategy
pattern (OCP) for fee calculation means fee rules are not encoded in SQL or
stored procedures — they are in Java strategy classes, which are testable,
versionable, and deployable independently of the database.
API IMPACT
SOLID shapes the API through SRP (one endpoint per use case) and OCP (new
policies can be added without breaking existing endpoints). Each REST
endpoint corresponds to one use case handler (SRP: the handler has one public
method, the controller has one endpoint method). New fee structures (OCP:
new FeeCalculator implementation) do not change existing endpoints — they
may add a new endpoint or a new request parameter, but existing endpoints
continue to work unchanged. This means the API is backward-compatible by
design: adding functionality does not break existing consumers. The DTO layer
(ISP: separate request and response DTOs, not a god-DTO) ensures that clients
depend only on the fields they use, reducing coupling between API and UI.
UI IMPACT
SOLID has indirect UI impact through API stability (SRP and OCP produce
backward-compatible APIs) and through the UI feature module structure (SRP
at the UI level: each feature module has one responsibility). The UI feature
modules (ADR-131) mirror the backend's SOLID structure: a Student feature
module, an Enrollment feature module, a Billing feature module — each with
one responsibility, extensible via composition (OCP at the UI level: new feature
modules are added without modifying existing ones). The UI's strategy pattern
(e.g., for rendering different report card formats) mirrors the backend's
strategy pattern, providing end-to-end consistency.
SECURITY IMPACT
SOLID improves security by localising security-critical logic. SRP ensures that
authorisation checks are in one place (the use case handler), not scattered
across controllers, services, and repositories. OCP ensures that new security
policies (e.g., a new role-based access rule) are added as new strategy
implementations, not by modifying existing handlers — reducing the risk of
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 102

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
breaking existing security controls. DIP ensures that security-critical
infrastructure (e.g., the encryption service, the audit logger) is accessed
through port interfaces, so security controls can be changed (e.g., upgrading
encryption algorithm) without touching application code. The combination
produces a security posture where controls are explicit, testable, and uniformly
applied.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
SOLID adds minimal performance overhead. The strategy pattern (OCP) adds
one virtual method dispatch (~1 nanosecond) per policy invocation —
negligible. The narrow interfaces (ISP) do not add overhead — Spring DI injects
the same implementation regardless of interface width. The one-public-method-
per-handler rule (SRP) does not add overhead. The benefit — small, focused
classes — improves JVM JIT optimisation (smaller methods are inlined more
aggressively) and reduces memory pressure (smaller classes have smaller
metadata). The overall performance impact is neutral to slightly positive; the
dominant benefit is development velocity.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
SOLID is a design-level principle, not a scaling principle, but it enables scaling
in two ways. First, SOLID-compliant code is easier to parallelise across teams:
small classes with single responsibilities have clear ownership boundaries, so
multiple teams can work on the same context without conflicts. Second, SOLID-
compliant code is easier to extract to microservices: a use case handler with
one responsibility and port-injected dependencies is a natural service boundary
— extracting it to a separate process requires replacing the port's
implementation with an HTTP client, not refactoring the handler. At 10x scale
(150 engineers), SOLID is the difference between a codebase that supports
parallel development and one that does not. At 100x scale (500 engineers),
SOLID is the foundation for any further decomposition.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
SOLID improves operability by making incidents localised and diagnosable. A
bug in fee calculation is in a FeeCalculator implementation (SRP: one
responsibility per class), not scattered across handlers and repositories. The
strategy pattern (OCP) means the active strategy is logged at invocation, so an
incident trace shows exactly which fee calculator ran. The port interfaces (DIP)
mean that infrastructure failures (e.g., database timeout) are caught at the port
boundary, with clear error context (which port, which method, which
aggregate). OpenTelemetry traces (ADR-122) span the strategy invocation and
port call, so the trace timeline shows which strategy was selected and how long
it took.

The static-analysis-only option (no code review for SOLID) was rejected
because SRP and OCP are partially subjective — method count is a proxy for
SRP, but a class with 5 methods can violate SRP if those methods serve
different responsibilities. Static analysis cannot capture 'reason to change';
only human judgement can. The code-review-only option (no static analysis)
was rejected because pre-v1.0 we tried it and enforcement was inconsistent
across reviewers, and principles eroded under deadline pressure. Static
analysis is the floor (mechanically enforced); code review is the ceiling
(nuanced judgement). The beyond-SOLID option (add YAGNI, KISS, DRY) was
rejected because these are heuristics, not principles — they conflict (DRY vs
YAGNI: 'don't repeat yourself' vs 'you aren't gonna need it') and are not
mechanically enforceable. YAGNI, KISS, DRY are guidance in ADR-001 (P5
Simplicity), not separate enforcement targets. SOLID is the right level of
formality for design-level enforcement.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q3-Q4 2025) refactored the codebase to comply with
SOLID. The migration was incremental: (a) extracted use case handlers from
god-services (SRP: one handler per use case, one public method); (b)
introduced strategy pattern for fee calculation, discount application,
notification channel selection, GST computation (OCP); (c) made value objects
immutable (LSP: final fields, constructor-only initialisation); (d) split god-
repositories into narrow per-aggregate interfaces (ISP); (e) introduced port
interfaces for all infrastructure dependencies (DIP, via ADR-007). Each step
was a 1-sprint effort per context, with ArchUnit and PMD rules added
incrementally. The migration was completed in December 2025 with zero

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
downtime. v3.0 adds the enforcement matrix (mapping each principle to its
rules and mechanisms) and the code review rubric for subjective principles
(SRP, OCP). Rollback plan: if a SOLID rule proves unworkable for a specific
context, the context can request an exception via the ADR process; if a rule
proves globally wrong, this ADR is superseded by a v2.0 with the revised rule
set.
TESTING STRATEGY
SOLID rules are tested via multiple mechanisms. ArchUnit tests verify: (a) one
public method per use case handler (SRP); (b) no interface has >10 methods
(ISP); (c) Application/Domain classes import no Infrastructure (DIP, via
ADR-007). PMD tests verify: (a) method count <=15 per class (SRP proxy); (b)
value objects have final fields only (LSP). Contract tests (ADR-149) verify: (a)
every repository implementation passes the port's contract test suite (LSP); (b)
every strategy implementation passes the strategy port's contract test suite
(LSP, OCP). Code review checklist verifies: (a) SRP — does the class have one
reason to change?; (b) OCP — was new behaviour added via new class or by
modifying existing?; (c) LSP — does the subtype honour the supertype's
contract? Coverage targets: 95%+ for Domain (where SOLID is most
impactful), 85%+ for Application, 70%+ for Infrastructure.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
SOLID adherence is monitored via the architecture scorecard, published
quarterly. Metrics tracked: (a) average method count per class (target: <10);
(b) average public method count per use case handler (target: 1); (c) average
method count per interface (target: <5); (d) strategy pattern usage count per
context (target: 2-5 strategies per context, indicating OCP adoption); (e) PMD
violation count per context (target: 0); (f) code review SOLID-checklist
completion rate (target: 100%). Per-strategy observability: strategy selection is
logged at invocation (which FeeCalculator ran for which enrollment), so
incidents can be traced to specific strategy implementations. OpenTelemetry
spans mark strategy invocations, so traces show which strategy was selected
and how long it took.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
SOLID is a stable principle set; no supersession expected. The enforcement
mechanisms may evolve: Error Prone (Google's static analysis) may supplement
PMD for more sophisticated SRP checks; ArchUnit may add new rules for OCP
(e.g., detecting modifications to strategy implementations that should be
additive). The principles themselves are unlikely to change — they have been
stable since 2000 (Robert C. Martin) and are widely adopted. The likely
successor to this ADR is a v2.0 that adds automated refactoring suggestions

Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and

ACCEPTED
DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Adopt the Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) pattern for
integration-heavy bounded contexts — Notification, Communication,
Reporting, and Billing — where multiple external integrations (Twilio SMS,
AWS SES email, Razorpay payment, WhatsApp Business API) must be
swappable without touching application or domain logic. Hexagonal
composes with Clean Architecture (ADR-003) as an explicit outer ring: ports
live in the Application layer, adapters live in the Infrastructure layer, and
the Domain layer remains pure.

CONTEXT
Clean Architecture (ADR-003) and the four-layer rules (ADR-006) define how
dependencies point inward, but they treat the boundary between application
logic and external systems as a single 'Infrastructure layer'. For most bounded
contexts (Enrollment, Student, Attendance) this single boundary is sufficient:
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 109

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
there is one database (PostgreSQL via JPA), one cache (Redis), and the
boundary is a Repository port plus a Cache port. The mapping from port to
implementation is one-to-one and stable. However, four contexts —
Notification, Communication, Reporting, and Billing — have integration
profiles that a single Infrastructure boundary cannot model cleanly.
Notification must deliver messages through SMS, email, WhatsApp, and in-app
push, with per-channel fallback chains (SMS fails -> email; email fails -> push).
Billing integrates with Razorpay (primary), Stripe (international expansion
roadmap), and a legacy direct-bank-transfer path for enterprise customers.
Communication integrates with Twilio for voice and messaging, AWS SES for
transactional email, and the school's own SMTP relay for branded email.
Reporting integrates with PostgreSQL read replicas for operational reports but
with Amazon Athena for cross-tenant analytical queries and with a third-party
PDF rendering service for report cards. The pre-v1.0 codebase handled this by
scattering integration code throughout the application layer: a
NotificationService that directly constructed Twilio API calls, an EmailSender
that imported AWS SES SDKs in the same package as business logic, and a
BillingService whose method bodies were 60% Razorpay client manipulation.
Switching SMS providers for a single school (a real customer request during
the 2024 launch) required touching 14 files across the Notification and
Communication contexts and introduced a regression that sent duplicate SMS
messages to 200 parents. The root cause was that no architectural seam
isolated 'what the application needs' from 'how the external system provides it'.
Hexagonal Architecture solves this by making the seam explicit and structural
rather than conventional. The application defines ports (interfaces) that
describe what it needs — 'send a message', 'charge a payment', 'render a
report' — and the infrastructure provides adapters (implementations) that
know how to satisfy each need against a specific external system. A Notification
use case depends on a SmsGateway port; a TwilioSmsAdapter and a
KaleyraSmsAdapter both implement that port; the active adapter is selected at
runtime via configuration, not by code changes. The v3.0 refresh formalises the
driving/driven port distinction (driving ports are how the outside world invokes
the application; driven ports are how the application invokes the outside world)
and the adapter lifecycle (adapters are registered in a Spring @Configuration,
selected via tenant-level or feature-flag routing, and unit-tested in isolation
against the port contract).
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary business driver is integration agility: PreOne operates in the
Indian market where integration partners change frequently. SMS providers
(Twilio, Kaleyra, MSG91, TextLocal) compete on per-message pricing that
varies by telecom circle and changes quarterly; the ability to switch providers
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 110

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
per-school or per-message-class without code changes is a direct margin lever.
A 0.02 INR per-SMS saving across 5,000 schools sending 2 million messages
per month is 40,000 INR/month in pure margin, recovered through
configuration alone. The secondary driver is multi-tenancy at the integration
layer: enterprise customers (large school chains) require integration with their
own SMTP relays, their own payment gateways (some mandate PayU instead of
Razorpay), and their own SSO providers. Hexagonal Architecture lets each
tenant route to a tenant-specific adapter without forking the application code.
The tertiary driver is testability: ports are pure Java interfaces, so use cases can
be unit-tested with mock adapters in milliseconds, without spinning up
Testcontainers for Twilio or Razorpay. This compresses the test suite for
Notification and Billing from ~30 seconds (Testcontainers-heavy) to under 3
seconds (port-mocked).
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Four integration-heavy bounded contexts (Notification, Communication,
Reporting, Billing) have multiple external integrations per concern, with
providers varying by tenant, by message class, and over time. The single
Infrastructure boundary defined by Clean Architecture (ADR-003) is too coarse
to model this variation. We need an explicit architectural seam — Ports and
Adapters — that isolates application intent from external-system mechanics,
enables runtime adapter selection, and makes integration code independently
testable.
CONSTRAINTS
● Adapters must be swappable at runtime via configuration, not via code
changes or redeployment
● Per-tenant adapter routing must be supported (enterprise customers
bring their own SMTP/payment/SSO)
● Port interfaces must live in the Application layer of Clean Architecture
(ADR-003), not in a separate 'ports' package
● Adapters must be unit-testable against the port contract without
Testcontainers or network access
● A failing adapter must trigger a fallback adapter chain (e.g., SMS ->
email -> push) declared in configuration
● ArchUnit (ADR-007) must mechanically enforce that no application
code imports an external SDK directly
● Adapter implementations must not leak external SDK types through the
port interface (no Twilio Type in a port method signature)
ASSUMPTIONS
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 111

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
● The set of integration concerns (SMS, email, payment, voice, push,
PDF, analytics) is stable; new concerns are rare and trigger a port
addition, not a structural change
● Spring's @Component-based DI is sufficient for adapter selection; no
custom service-locator framework is needed
● External SDKs expose async or blocking APIs that can be wrapped
behind a synchronous port interface (acceptable latency cost)
● Per-tenant adapter routing decisions can be made at request entry and
propagated via thread-local or request context
● Fallback chains are declarative (configuration-driven) and
deterministic, not ML-driven or heuristic
● The four integration-heavy contexts will remain a minority — most
contexts will continue using the simpler 4-layer model without explicit
ports

DECISION
ADOPTED
We adopt Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) for the four
integration-heavy bounded contexts: Notification (ntf), Communication
(com), Reporting (rpt), and Billing (bill). The other eight contexts continue
with the default 4-layer Clean Architecture (ADR-003/ADR-006) without
explicit ports. Within the four hexagonal contexts: (1) Driving ports are use-
case interfaces defined in the Application layer (e.g.,
SendNotificationUseCase) — primary adapters (REST controllers, message
listeners, scheduled job runners) implement inbound transport and invoke
driving ports. (2) Driven ports are integration interfaces defined in the
Application layer (e.g., SmsGateway, EmailGateway, PaymentGateway,
PdfRenderer) — secondary adapters (TwilioSmsAdapter, SesEmailAdapter,
RazorpayPaymentAdapter, AthenaReportAdapter) implement outbound
transport and are injected into use cases. (3) Adapter selection is via a
Spring @Configuration that reads tenant-level and feature-flag
configuration and registers the active adapter bean per request context;
fallback chains are declared in YAML and resolved by a
FallbackResolvingAdapter that wraps the primary adapter. (4) Port
interfaces must reference only domain types, primitive types, or
Application-layer DTOs — never external SDK types (ArchUnit-enforced).
(5) Every adapter has a contract test suite (ADR-149) that runs against a
mock of the external system; integration tests against the real external
system run nightly in a staging environment only.

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
DETAILED RATIONALE
Hexagonal Architecture was chosen over the alternatives because it is the only
option that makes the application-intent vs external-mechanics seam structural
rather than conventional. The Strategy Pattern (rejected option 3) is the same
idea expressed as a design pattern rather than as an architectural pattern; the
difference matters because design patterns are applied at the class level by
individual engineers, while architectural patterns are applied at the context
level by the architecture and enforced by ArchUnit. The pre-v1.0 failure mode
was not that engineers did not know the Strategy Pattern — it was that there
was no rule forcing them to apply it. Hexagonal Architecture, enforced by
ArchUnit tests that fail the build when application code imports an external
SDK, converts the pattern from a suggestion into a constraint. The scoping
decision — Hexagonal for four contexts, not all twelve — is the most important
judgement call in this ADR. Applying Hexagonal uniformly (rejected option 2)
would impose ceremony on contexts that do not benefit from it. The Enrollment
context has one database and one cache; defining an EnrollmentRepository
port and a EnrollmentCache port, each with a single implementation, adds two
interfaces, two adapter classes, and a Spring configuration file for zero
behavioural benefit — the implementation cannot be swapped because there is
no alternative to swap to. The engineering survey (87% opposed to uniform
application) confirmed that ceremony without benefit erodes morale and slows
delivery. The four chosen contexts are precisely those where (a) multiple
external integrations exist per concern, (b) integrations vary by tenant, or (c)
integrations change over time. These three properties are the test for whether
a context should adopt Hexagonal; future contexts that develop these
properties are candidates for adoption via a follow-up ADR. The composition
with Clean Architecture is deliberate and explicit. Hexagonal is not a
replacement for the 4-layer model (ADR-006); it is a refinement of the
Infrastructure layer's internal structure. Ports live in the Application layer
because they express application intent ('I need to send an SMS') and depend
only on domain types — placing them in Infrastructure would invert the
dependency (Application depending on Infrastructure), violating ADR-007.
Adapters live in the Infrastructure layer because they depend on external
SDKs, which are infrastructure concerns. The Domain layer is unaffected — it
remains pure Java with no knowledge that hexagonal is in use. This composition
means that an engineer reading the Enrollment context (non-hexagonal) and
the Notification context (hexagonal) sees the same Domain and Application
structure; the only difference is that Notification's Application layer has more
interfaces (ports) and its Infrastructure layer has more concrete classes
(adapters). The driving/driven port distinction (formalised in v3.0) resolves a
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 115

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
recurring ambiguity from v1.0, where engineers conflated 'ports' with
'repository interfaces'. A driving port is the entry point through which the
outside world invokes the application — a use case interface like
SendNotificationUseCase, implemented by the application and invoked by a
primary adapter (a REST controller). A driven port is the exit point through
which the application invokes the outside world — an integration interface like
SmsGateway, defined by the application and implemented by a secondary
adapter (TwilioSmsAdapter). This distinction matters because driving ports
have one implementation (the application) and many callers (adapters), while
driven ports have one caller (the application) and many implementations
(adapters). The test design differs: driving ports are tested by adapter tests that
verify the adapter invokes the port correctly; driven ports are tested by
contract tests that verify every adapter satisfies the port's behavioural
contract. Conflating the two produced confusing test suites in v1.0 — the v3.0
taxonomy eliminates the confusion. The fallback chain mechanism is the most
operationally important refinement in v3.0. In v1.0, fallback logic was scattered
across use cases (if SMS fails, try email) and was inconsistent — Notification
had one fallback order, Communication had another, and Billing had none. The
v3.0 model centralises fallback in a FallbackResolvingAdapter that wraps the
primary adapter, reads the chain from YAML (e.g., ntf.channels.sms.fallback:
[twilio, kaleyra, msg91]), and tries each adapter in order until one succeeds.
This makes fallback chains auditable, testable, and configurable per-tenant
without code changes. The cost is one extra layer of indirection (a wrapper
around each adapter), which is negligible compared to the network latency of
the external call itself. The most likely counter-argument is that Hexagonal
adds indirection that makes debugging harder — a stack trace now traverses
UseCase -> Port -> Adapter -> SDK, four frames instead of two. The counter-
counter-argument is that the indirection is exactly what enables the testability
and swappability that justify the pattern; the four-frame stack is intentional and
the additional frames carry meaningful information (which port, which
adapter). The debugging concern is further mitigated by structured logging at
each frame (ADR-119) and by OpenTelemetry trace propagation (ADR-122) that
correlates the frames into a single trace. The measured debugging time for
Notification incidents dropped 40% post-v1.0 because the trace clearly shows
'Twilio adapter returned 403' rather than an opaque 'SMS sending failed' — the
indirection improved debuggability, not degraded it.

DATABASE IMPACT
Hexagonal Architecture has no direct database schema impact — the four
hexagonal contexts continue to use the same PostgreSQL schema (ADR-041)
with the same table prefixes (ntf_*, com_*, rpt_*, bill_*) as in v1.0. The
Repository port pattern (a driven port) is already in use across all contexts;
Hexagonal formalises it but does not change the schema. However, two indirect
database impacts exist: (1) the adapter-selection audit log — every adapter
invocation (especially fallback chain transitions) is recorded in a new
ntf_adapter_audit table for compliance and for SLA reporting to schools; this
table is append-only, partitioned by month, and retained for 90 days (ADR-048
audit pattern). (2) The Reporting context's hexagonal adoption introduces a
read-model split: operational reports use the AthenaReportAdapter (querying
Amazon Athena via the AWS SDK), while transactional reports use the
JpaReportAdapter (querying the PostgreSQL read replica); both implement the
ReportQueryPort, and the routing is based on report type, not tenant. This split
means the rpt_context no longer assumes PostgreSQL is the only read source —
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 118

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
a precondition for future analytical workloads on S3-based data lakes
(ADR-061).
API IMPACT
The public REST API surface (ADR-091) is unchanged by Hexagonal adoption —
the same endpoints exist (/api/v1/notifications, /api/v1/billing/charges,
/api/v1/reports/*, /api/v1/communication/*). The primary adapters (REST
controllers) now invoke driving ports instead of use case classes directly, but
this is an internal refactoring invisible to API consumers. One observable API
change: the X-Adapter-Used response header on Notification and Billing
responses, which identifies which secondary adapter handled the request (e.g.,
X-Adapter-Used: kaleyra-sms). This header supports school-level SLA reporting
and parent-side debugging ('why did my SMS come from Kaleyra instead of
Twilio?'). The header is informational and does not affect client behaviour; it is
documented in the OpenAPI spec under each Notification and Billing endpoint.
Internal API contracts (between contexts, via the public API packages per
ADR-005) are unaffected — the port interfaces are an internal concern of each
hexagonal context, not exposed to other contexts.
UI IMPACT
The UI is unaffected at the structural level — it calls the same REST endpoints
and receives the same response shapes. However, the X-Adapter-Used header
enables a new UI capability in the admin console: a 'Delivery Diagnostics' panel
for school admins that shows, per notification, which adapter was used, the
latency, and the fallback chain trace. This panel helps admins understand why a
parent reported not receiving an SMS (e.g., 'Twilio returned 403 at 14:02, fell
back to Kaleyra at 14:03, delivered successfully'). The panel is read-only and
pulls from the ntf_adapter_audit table. For Billing, the admin console shows the
payment gateway used per charge, which is relevant for finance reconciliation
(Razorpay settlements vs Stripe settlements appear on different bank
statements). No UI architectural changes are required; the data is already
available via the existing reporting API.
SECURITY IMPACT
Hexagonal Architecture improves security posture in three ways. First,
credential isolation: each adapter holds its own credentials (Twilio API key, SES
SMTP password, Razorpay key pair) in AWS Secrets Manager (ADR-080), and
credentials are never shared across adapters. A compromised Twilio credential
does not grant access to SES or Razorpay. Second, the ArchUnit rule forbidding
Application code from importing SDK packages prevents a class of supply-chain
attack: if a malicious PR adds a Twilio SDK call directly in a use case, the
ArchUnit test fails the build. Third, the audit log (ntf_adapter_audit) records
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 119

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
every external call with tenant, timestamp, adapter, request hash, and
response status — providing the evidence chain required by DPDP Act 2023 for
any data sent to third-party processors. The fallback chain is security-relevant:
if Twilio is compromised or rate-limited, the chain automatically routes to
Kaleyra, ensuring delivery continuity without manual intervention. Per-tenant
adapter routing (enterprise customers using their own SMTP) is enforced at the
adapter-selection layer, not at the application layer — a tenant's data never
touches another tenant's adapter, preserving tenant isolation (P1).
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
Hexagonal adds one layer of indirection per external call (port -> adapter vs
direct SDK call), which adds ~0.05ms of JVM overhead per call — negligible
compared to the 50-200ms latency of the external API itself. The
FallbackResolvingAdapter adds another layer, but only when fallback is
triggered (rare; ~0.3% of SMS calls fall back in production). The adapter-
selection logic (reading tenant config, resolving the bean) adds ~0.2ms per
request, cached for 5 minutes per tenant. The net performance impact is under
1ms per external call, well within the latency budget. A positive performance
impact: adapter contract tests run in milliseconds (mocked) instead of the 200-
500ms that Testcontainers-based integration tests took in pre-v1.0 — the
Notification test suite dropped from 28 seconds to 2.1 seconds, accelerating the
CI feedback loop. The Reporting context's Athena adapter has higher latency
(2-5 seconds per query) than the JPA adapter (50-200ms), but this is intrinsic to
Athena, not to Hexagonal; the routing rule (operational reports -> JPA,
analytical reports -> Athena) ensures the slower path is used only when the
query genuinely spans the analytical dataset.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
Hexagonal Architecture scales horizontally without structural changes: each
adapter is a stateless Spring bean, and adapter instances scale with the
application replicas (ADR-126). The external systems (Twilio, SES, Razorpay)
have their own rate limits, which the adapters enforce via token-bucket rate
limiting (Resilience4j RateLimiter) — when a rate limit is hit, the fallback chain
engages, distributing load across providers. This is a scalability advantage over
a single-provider architecture: peak SMS volume during fee-due reminders (3
million SMS in a 2-hour window on the 1st of every month) exceeds Twilio's per-
account rate limit, so the fallback chain automatically distributes load across
Twilio, Kaleyra, and MSG91. Per-tenant adapter routing scales to thousands of
tenants without performance degradation — the tenant-to-adapter mapping is
cached in Redis (ADR-073) with a 5-minute TTL, and cache misses are rare
(only on first request per tenant per 5-minute window). The adapter audit log
(ntf_adapter_audit) is the main scalability concern: at 3 million SMS/month plus
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 120

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
1 million emails/month, the table grows by ~4 million rows/month. Monthly
partitioning (ADR-053) and a 90-day retention keep the table at ~12 million
rows active, which PostgreSQL handles comfortably. Archival to S3 (ADR-061)
handles the long-term retention requirement.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Operations benefit from Hexagonal because each adapter is independently
observable and configurable. A Grafana dashboard per adapter shows request
rate, latency p50/p99, error rate, rate-limit utilisation, and fallback-chain
trigger count. Alerts fire on: adapter error rate >2%, adapter latency p99 >1s
(SMS/email)  or >5s (payment/Athena),  fallback-chain trigger rate >5%
(indicates a degraded primary provider), and credential-expiry warnings (30
days before Secrets Manager rotation). Adapter configuration is externalised in
YAML and reloadable without restart (Spring Cloud Refresh), so provider
switching (e.g., migrating from Twilio to Kaleyra for a school) takes effect
within 60 seconds. On-call engineers debug adapter failures via the trace ID,
which propagates from the use case through the port to the adapter to the
external SDK call — a single trace shows the entire path. The fallback chain is
the primary operational resilience mechanism: a provider outage does not
require paging the on-call engineer because the chain handles it automatically;
the engineer is paged only if the entire chain is exhausted (all three SMS
providers fail), which has not occurred in production since v1.0 launch.

ArchUnit enforcement prevents SDK Engineers must learn the driving/driven
leakage into application code port distinction; onboarding time +0.5
days for the four contexts
REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
The Strategy Pattern option (rejected) was the closest competitor and the most
debated. The argument for it was simplicity: Spring's @Qualifier and @Primary
already provide adapter selection, and the Strategy Pattern is familiar to every
engineer. The argument against it — which carried — was that the Strategy
Pattern is a class-level design pattern, not an architectural pattern, and
therefore has no mechanical enforcement. The pre-v1.0 codebase used the
Strategy Pattern in three places (Notification, Billing, Reporting) and in all
three the strategy interfaces leaked SDK types within 6 months because
nothing prevented it. Hexagonal Architecture, with its ArchUnit enforcement,
converts the same idea from a suggestion into a constraint — and the constraint
is what produces the durability. The uniform-application option (Hexagonal
everywhere) was rejected on simplicity grounds (ADR-001 P5): applying
ceremony to contexts that do not benefit from it (Enrollment, Student,
Attendance — single-database, single-cache) would add 2 interfaces and 2
adapter classes per Repository for zero behavioural value. The engineering
survey (87% opposed) confirmed that ceremony without benefit is a morale and
velocity cost. The 5-layer option was rejected because ADR-006 already decided
the 4-layer default; Hexagonal composes within the 4 layers (ports in
Application, adapters in Infrastructure) rather than adding a 5th layer, which
would contradict ADR-006 and require a layering-rules supersession. The
composition approach — Hexagonal as a refinement of the Infrastructure
layer's internal structure — preserves ADR-006's authority while giving the
four integration-heavy contexts the seam they need.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q4 2025) applied Hexagonal to the four contexts
incrementally over 6 sprints, one context per 1.5 sprints. Each context
migration followed the same playbook: (a) inventory existing external SDK calls
in application and (incorrectly-placed) domain packages; (b) define driven port
interfaces in the application layer, with method signatures referencing only
domain types or primitive types; (c) extract each SDK call into a secondary
adapter class implementing the relevant port; (d) introduce the
FallbackResolvingAdapter wrapper and migrate fallback logic from use cases
to the wrapper; (e) introduce the AdapterRouter for per-tenant selection,
backed by the tenant_integration_routing table; (f) add ArchUnit tests
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 124

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
forbidding application code from importing SDK packages; (g) add contract test
suites per adapter using mocked SDKs; (h) add nightly integration tests against
real staging external systems. The Notification context was migrated first (most
painful, most beneficial) and served as the template; Communication,
Reporting, and Billing followed. Total migration: 18 engineer-weeks across Q4
2025, zero downtime (modular monolith deployed continuously), zero data loss.
The v3.0 refresh adds the driving/driven port taxonomy (terminology only, no
code change), the FallbackResolvingAdapter (already present in v1.0 but
unnamed), and the X-Adapter-Used response header (new observable).
Rollback plan: if Hexagonal proves unworkable for a context, the adapters can
be collapsed back into the application layer mechanically (port interface ->
direct SDK call), but this has not been needed and is not anticipated; the v1.0
results (40% faster incident debugging, 0.02 INR/SMS saved via provider
switching, 92% reduction in test suite time) make rollback economically
irrational.
TESTING STRATEGY
Three test layers per hexagonal context. (1) Unit tests: use cases tested with
mocked driven ports (Mockito), verifying the use case invokes the port with the
correct arguments and handles receipts and failures correctly. These run in
<1ms each, 95%+ coverage of use case logic. (2) Adapter contract tests: each
adapter implementation tested against the port contract using a mocked SDK
(MockWebServer for HTTP-based SDKs, in-memory mocks for AWS SDKs).
These verify the adapter translates domain types to SDK calls correctly,
handles SDK exceptions, and produces the correct receipt or failure. These run
in ~50ms each, one suite per adapter. (3) Integration tests: each adapter tested
against the real external system in staging (Twilio test credentials, SES
sandbox, Razorpay test mode, Athena workgroup). These run nightly (not on
every PR) due to external-system rate limits and cost. They verify the contract
tests did not diverge from reality. ArchUnit tests in CI enforce: (a) no class in
*.application.* imports an external SDK package; (b) every class implementing
a port interface is in *.infrastructure.*; (c) port interfaces have no method
parameters or return types from external SDK packages. The architecture
scorecard (ADR-158) reports per-context port count, adapter count, contract
test coverage, and nightly integration test pass rate quarterly.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Every adapter emits structured logs (JSON, ADR-119) with: adapter name, port
name, tenant ID, request hash (not full payload, for privacy), response status,
latency, and fallback-chain position (primary, fallback-1, fallback-2).
Prometheus metrics (ADR-121) expose per-adapter counters:
preone_adapter_requests_total{context, port, adapter, status},
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 125

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
preone_adapter_latency_seconds{context, port, adapter} histogram,
preone_adapter_fallback_total{context, port, from_adapter, to_adapter},
preone_adapter_rate_limit_hits_total{adapter}. OpenTelemetry traces
(ADR-122) propagate from the use case through the port to the adapter to the
SDK call, with span attributes for adapter name, provider, and tenant. A
dedicated Grafana dashboard per context shows: adapter request rate (stacked
by adapter), latency p50/p99 per adapter, error rate per adapter, fallback
trigger rate per provider, and rate-limit utilisation. Alerts: adapter error rate
>2% for 5 minutes (page on-call); fallback rate >5% for 10 minutes (page on-
call, indicates primary degradation); adapter latency p99 >1s for SMS/email or
>5s for payment/Athena for 5 minutes (page on-call); credential-expiry warning
at 30 days (ticket, not page); nightly integration test failure (ticket, reviewed in
morning standup).
FUTURE EVOLUTION
Hexagonal Architecture for the four contexts is stable; no supersession
expected. Evolution will be additive: (a) new external integration classes (e.g.,
WhatsApp Business API, voice via Exotel, push via APNS) will be added as new
driven ports with corresponding adapters — no structural change. (b) New
contexts that develop integration-heavy profiles (Student context may adopt a
biometric-attendance integration in 2027) will be evaluated for Hexagonal
adoption via a follow-up ADR citing the three-property test (multiple
integrations, per-tenant variation, integration changes over time). (c) The
adapter lifecycle may evolve to support hot-swapping (swap an adapter without
restart) — currently adapters are swapped via Spring Cloud Refresh (60-second
delay); a future event-driven adapter registry could reduce this to sub-second.
(d) The fallback chain is currently declarative (YAML); a future evolution could
make it adaptive (learn which provider is currently fastest and prefer it) — this
is deferred until we have 12 months of adapter performance data to train on. (e)
If PreOne adopts an event-streaming backbone (Kafka, deferred per ADR-027),
the driven ports for event publishing will be re-evaluated — currently the
EventPublisher port is implemented by an in-process adapter; a Kafka-backed
adapter would be a drop-in replacement thanks to the port abstraction.

DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Adopt a canonical Java package structure for the PreOne platform:
com.preone.<module>.<layer>.<aggregate>, with lowercase segments,
no underscores, singular aggregate names, and a forbidden-suffix list (Util,
Helper, Manager, Impl except as interface-implementation pairing).
Package structure maps 1:1 to module-info.java declarations, so the
package layout is enforced at compile time, not just by convention.

CONTEXT
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 129

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
The Clean Architecture (ADR-003), Layering Rules (ADR-006), and Bounded
Context Strategy (ADR-005) define WHAT the structural units of the PreOne
codebase are — four layers, twelve contexts, aggregate roots within contexts.
But they do not define HOW those units are expressed as Java packages. In the
pre-v1.0 codebase, package structure was a free-for-all: Enrollment code lived
in com.preone.enrollment, com.preone.enrollments,
com.preone.enrollment.service, com.preone.enrollment.services,
com.preone.enrollment.impl, and com.preone.enrollment.util simultaneously
— six packages for one context, chosen by engineer preference rather than
rule. Cross-context imports were ambiguous: did com.preone.enrollment.dto
refer to Enrollment's DTOs or to a shared DTO package? (It was the former, but
no one could be sure without reading the imports.) Utility code was scattered
across 14 *Util classes in 9 packages, with overlapping methods
(DateUtils.parse and DateHelper.parse, both calling the same
SimpleDateFormat) and inconsistent null-handling. The Office of the Chief
Architect defined a canonical package structure in Q3 2025 to eliminate this
ambiguity. The structure had three goals: (1) every package's purpose should
be inferrable from its name alone — an engineer seeing
com.preone.enrollment.application.enrollcmd should know immediately this is
the Enrollment context's Application layer, EnrollCommand use case; (2) the
structure should map cleanly to module-info.java so that the module system
enforces boundaries at compile time, not just at code review; (3) the structure
should forbid the patterns that produced the pre-v1.0 mess — *Util packages,
*Impl suffixes (except for explicit interface-implementation pairing), plural
package names (enrollments vs enrollment), and shared packages that cross
context boundaries. The v3.0 refresh adds two refinements: the sub-aggregate
package rule (large aggregates with >15 classes get their own sub-package
under the aggregate package, e.g.,
com.preone.enrollment.domain.enrollment.valueobject for the Enrollment
aggregate's value objects) and the explicit module-info.java mapping (every
context has a module-info.java that exports only its public API package and
requires its dependency contexts' public API packages). These refinements
close the last loopholes that allowed pre-v1.0-style package fragmentation to
re-emerge.
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary driver is onboarding speed: a canonical package structure lets new
engineers navigate the codebase without a guide. A new engineer joining the
Enrollment team can open com.preone.enrollment and see the four-layer
structure immediately, open com.preone.enrollment.domain.enrollment and
see the aggregate's entities and value objects, and open
com.preone.enrollment.application.enrollcmd and see the use case. This
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 130

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
compresses onboarding from '3 days to find the right file' (pre-v1.0) to '3
minutes to find the right file' (post-v1.0, measured in onboarding surveys). The
secondary driver is mechanical boundary enforcement: when packages map 1:1
to module-info.java, the Java module system enforces context boundaries at
compile time. A PR that adds an import from com.preone.billing.domain to
com.preone.enrollment.application fails to compile — not 'fails code review' but
'fails to compile'. This eliminates an entire class of boundary violations that
ArchUnit (ADR-007) catches only at test time. The tertiary driver is refactoring
safety: when every context follows the same package structure, automated
refactoring tools (IntelliJ, OpenRewrite) can apply cross-cutting changes (e.g.,
'rename all *Service classes to *UseCase') safely, because the structure
guarantees no surprises. Pre-v1.0, such refactoring was manual and error-
prone.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The PreOne codebase lacks a canonical Java package structure, leading to
fragmentation (six packages for one context), ambiguity (cannot infer package
purpose from name), and unenforced boundaries (cross-context imports slip
through code review). We need a package convention that is inferrable from the
name, maps to module-info.java for compile-time enforcement, and forbids the
patterns that produced the pre-v1.0 mess.
CONSTRAINTS
● Package names must be all-lowercase (Java convention, no exceptions)
● Package segments must be singular (enrollment, not enrollments) —
aggregates are singular, collections are plural but live in plural-named
classes within singular packages
● No underscores, hyphens, or special characters in package names (Java
keyword safety and URL-friendliness)
● The top-level segment after com.preone must be a bounded context
short-code (ADR-005): idm, acs, stu, grd, tch, enr, bill, att, rpt, ntf, com,
aud
● The second segment must be a layer name: api, application, domain,
infrastructure (ADR-006)
● The third segment (in domain and application layers) must be an
aggregate root name or a use case name (lowercase, no suffix)
● The public API package of each context must be <context>.api
(exported in module-info.java); all other packages are not exported
● No *Util, *Helper, *Manager, *Data, *Info packages or classes
(forbidden suffix list)
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 131

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
● module-info.java must be present in every context's root package and
must export only the .api package
ASSUMPTIONS
● The 12 bounded contexts (ADR-005) are stable; new contexts are added
rarely and follow the same package structure
● Java module system (JPMS) is supported by the build (Maven, Java 21)
and by the IDE (IntelliJ, VS Code)
● Engineers will accept the constraint of no *Util/*Helper classes (the
main source of pre-v1.0 pushback)
● Aggregate roots are the natural unit for sub-package organisation
within domain and application layers
● Public API packages are sufficient for cross-context communication; no
'shared' or 'common' packages are needed
● The package structure does not need to encode deployment boundaries
(deployment is per-ADR-002, single deployable)

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADOPTED
We adopt the canonical package structure
com.preone.<context>.<layer>.<aggregate> for all 12 bounded contexts,
with the following rules. (1) Root: com.preone is the platform root; the next
segment is a context short-code from ADR-005 (idm, acs, stu, grd, tch, enr,
bill, att, rpt, ntf, com, aud). (2) Layer: the next segment is one of api,
application, domain, infrastructure (ADR-006). (3) Aggregate: in domain
and application layers, the next segment is an aggregate root name
(lowercase, singular, no suffix) — e.g.,
com.preone.enrollment.domain.enrollment,
com.preone.enrollment.domain.feecharge,
com.preone.enrollment.application.enrollcmd. (4) Sub-aggregate: large
aggregates (>15 classes) get a valueobject or event sub-package — e.g.,
com.preone.enrollment.domain.enrollment.valueobject. (5) Public API:
each context's <context>.api package is the only exported package in
module-info.java; all other packages are not exported and accessible only
within the module. (6) Forbidden suffixes: no class or package may end with
Util, Helper, Manager, Data, Info, or Impl (except Impl as an explicit
interface-implementation pairing where the interface is in the same
package and the implementation is the only one). (7) module-info.java:
present in every context's root package (com.preone.<context>), exports
<context>.api, requires the public API packages of dependency contexts.
(8) No shared/common packages: cross-cutting concerns live in
com.preone.platform.<concern> (e.g., com.preone.platform.tenant,
com.preone.platform.audit), which is a separate module required by all
contexts.
DETAILED RATIONALE
The chosen structure was selected over the flat option (no aggregate segment)
because aggregates are the natural unit of DDD thinking (ADR-004) and
because the pre-v1.0 Enrollment context — 60+ classes in a single domain
package — was demonstrably unnavigable. Engineers spent an average of 4
minutes per task 'finding the right file' in pre-v1.0 surveys; the aggregate-
segmented structure reduced this to under 30 seconds in post-v1.0 surveys.
The aggregate segment also enables a future evolution where an aggregate is
extracted to its own module (e.g., if FeeCharge grows complex enough to
warrant its own deployment unit); the package boundary is already correct, so
extraction is mechanical. The feature-based option (rejected) was tempting
because it aligns with frontend conventions and with the 'vertical slice'
architecture popular in .NET. The argument against it — which carried
decisively in ARB review — is that features cut across aggregates. Enroll,
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 135

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
Withdraw, and Transfer are three use cases (features) that all operate on the
Enrollment aggregate; a feature-based structure would either duplicate the
Enrollment aggregate code across three feature packages (DRY violation) or
force the aggregate into a shared sub-package (which defeats the feature-based
premise). DDD's aggregate-first thinking (ADR-004) is the correct organising
principle for the domain; the chosen structure honours it. The hexagonal-
flavoured option (rejected) would have added a port/adapter segment for the
four hexagonal contexts (ADR-009). The argument against it is uniformity: 8 of
12 contexts are not hexagonal, and adding a port/adapter segment to the 4 that
are would create two package structures to learn. The port/adapter distinction
is already expressed structurally — ports are interfaces in the application
package, adapters are classes in the infrastructure package — and ArchUnit
(ADR-007) enforces that ports have no SDK imports. A package-name prefix
would be redundant with the existing enforcement. The chosen structure treats
hexagonal as an internal concern of the four contexts, invisible at the package
level. The forbidden-suffix list is the most-debated part of this ADR. The *Util
and *Helper suffixes are forbidden because they are the pre-v1.0 dumping
ground for code that did not fit elsewhere — 14 *Util classes with overlapping
methods, inconsistent null-handling, and no test coverage. The replacement is
to put utility code where it belongs: date parsing on the value object that
represents the date; string normalisation on the value object that represents
the string; collection helpers as static methods on a domain service or as
methods on the collection itself. Where genuinely cross-cutting utility code
exists (e.g., a clock abstraction for testability), it lives in
com.preone.platform.<concern> as a first-class module, not as a *Util class.
The *Manager suffix is forbidden because it is vague — a 'manager' does not
specify what it manages or how; the replacement is a specific name
(NotificationDispatcher, FeeCalculator, EnrollmentRepository). The *Data and
*Info suffixes are forbidden because they are DTOs in disguise; the replacement
is an explicit DTO suffix (EnrollmentDto) or a record (EnrollmentView) per
ADR-011. The *Impl suffix is conditionally allowed: when an interface and its
single implementation live in the same package and the implementation is the
only one, *Impl is permitted (e.g., EnrollCommandHandlerImpl implements
EnrollCommandHandler). This is the standard Java pattern for Spring beans
where the interface is for testing (mock) and the implementation is the
production bean. The condition 'single implementation' is enforced by
ArchUnit: if a second implementation appears, the *Impl suffix must be
replaced with a descriptive name (e.g., JpaEnrollCommandHandler). This
prevents the pre-v1.0 pattern where 20 *Impl classes accumulated without
descriptive names, making the codebase opaque. The module-info.java
mapping is the structural enforcement backbone. Every context has a module-
info.java at com.preone.<context> that declares: module
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 136

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
com.preone.enrollment { exports com.preone.enrollment.api; requires
com.preone.student.api; requires com.preone.platform.tenant; requires
spring.boot; ... }. This means: (a) only the .api package is accessible from other
modules — internal packages are compile-inaccessible; (b) dependencies on
other contexts must be declared explicitly (no transitive context dependencies);
(c) the module system catches circular dependencies at compile time (if
Enrollment requires Student and Student requires Enrollment, the compiler
fails). This is stronger enforcement than ArchUnit (which runs at test time) —
the module system fails at compile time, before any test runs. The v3.0 refresh
added this mapping because v1.0 relied on ArchUnit alone, and a few boundary
violations slipped through to PR review before ArchUnit caught them in CI; the
module system now catches them at the developer's IDE, before the PR is even
created. The sub-aggregate package rule (added in v3.0) addresses a v1.0
scaling problem: the Enrollment aggregate grew to 22 classes (entity, 8 value
objects, 4 domain events, 3 domain services, 6 specification classes) in a single
com.preone.enrollment.domain.enrollment package, making it hard to
navigate. The rule: when an aggregate exceeds 15 classes, sub-packages
valueobject, event, service, and specification are created under the aggregate
package. This keeps packages navigable without changing the top-level
structure. The threshold (15) was chosen empirically: packages under 15
classes are scannable in one screen; packages above 15 require scrolling,
which degrades navigation. The sub-package rule is opt-in per aggregate (not
all aggregates need it) and is enforced by a CI check that flags aggregates
exceeding 15 classes without sub-packages. The most likely counter-argument
is that the structure is over-specified and leaves no room for engineer
judgement. The counter-counter-argument is that the structure specifies only
the package layout, not the class design within packages — engineers retain
full freedom on class design, method design, and internal organisation. The
structure removes only the decisions that should not be left to engineer
preference (where does this class go? what do we name this package?) because
those decisions, made inconsistently, produce the pre-v1.0 mess. The measured
productivity impact (onboarding time down from 3 days to 3 minutes,
refactoring safety up, navigation time down 80%) justifies the constraint.

DATABASE IMPACT
The package structure has no direct database schema impact — schemas are
governed by ADR-041 (database strategy) and per-context migrations.
However, there is an indirect impact on migration file organisation: Flyway
migration files (ADR-057) are organised to mirror the package structure. Each
context has its own migration directory (db/migration/enrollment,
db/migration/billing, etc.) and migration files are prefixed with the context
short-code (V20250115_001__enr_create_enrollments_table.sql). This mirrors
the package structure: an engineer looking at the enr_enrollments table can
find the migration in db/migration/enrollment and the JPA entity in
com.preone.enrollment.infrastructure.jpa. The 1:1 mapping between package,
table prefix, and migration directory is a navigability aid that compounds over
time — pre-v1.0, migrations were in a single directory with inconsistent
prefixes, making it hard to find which migration created which table.
API IMPACT
The package structure directly shapes the REST API surface (ADR-091). Each
context's REST controllers live in <context>.api, and the API path prefix
mirrors the context short-code: /api/v1/enrollments, /api/v1/billing,
/api/v1/notifications. This means the package structure is visible to API
consumers (via the path prefix) and to API documentation (the OpenAPI tag is
the context short-code). Internal API contracts (between contexts, via public
API packages per ADR-005) follow the same structure:
com.preone.enrollment.api.EnrollmentPublicApi is the interface other contexts
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 139

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
import; its methods are the only cross-context callable surface. The module-
info.java exports only .api, so other contexts cannot accidentally import internal
packages — this is compile-time enforcement of the public API contract,
stronger than ArchUnit's test-time enforcement.
UI IMPACT
The package structure has no direct UI impact — the React frontend (ADR-131)
has its own folder structure (src/contexts/<context>/...) that mirrors the
backend's package structure for symmetry. A UI engineer working on
Enrollment features opens src/contexts/enrollment/ and finds components,
hooks, and API calls for that context; the folder structure mirrors the backend's
com.preone.enrollment.api so that the UI-to-backend mapping is obvious. This
symmetry is not enforced by the backend ADR but is documented in ADR-131
(frontend architecture) as a recommended convention. The backend package
structure's main UI impact is via the API path prefix: the UI's API client (a
generated TypeScript SDK from OpenAPI, ADR-091) uses the same context-
prefix paths, so the UI's notion of 'context' aligns with the backend's.
SECURITY IMPACT
The package structure improves security by making the public API surface
explicit and minimal. Because module-info.java exports only .api, an attacker
who finds an RCE in a controller cannot directly access internal domain or
infrastructure classes via reflection across module boundaries (JPMS enforces
module boundaries even under reflection, unless the module is opened). This is
defence-in-depth: even if the API layer is compromised, the internal layers are
not directly accessible. The forbidden-suffix list (*Util, *Helper) eliminates a
class of 'god classes' that accumulated cross-cutting responsibilities in pre-v1.0
— these classes were security risks because they were touched by every feature
and any bug in them affected every feature. The per-context isolation also
supports tenant isolation (P1): a tenant's data flows through one context's
packages, and cross-context access goes through explicitly-declared module
dependencies, making it impossible for one context's package to accidentally
read another context's data without an explicit dependency declaration that
ArchUnit and the module system both verify.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
The package structure has negligible runtime performance impact — Java
packages are a compile-time concept; at runtime, the JVM sees a flat class
namespace (modulo module boundaries, which add a small lookup cost on first
access). The module system adds ~1ms to cold-start class loading per module,
totalling ~12ms for 12 modules — negligible against the 30-second JVM
startup. The build-time impact is positive: the module system enables
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 140

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
incremental compilation at the module level, so a change in Enrollment does
not recompile Billing unless Billing depends on Enrollment's .api package. Pre-
v1.0 (no modules), a change in any class triggered a full recompile (~90
seconds); post-v1.0 (modules), a change in Enrollment's domain layer triggers
recompilation only of Enrollment and its dependents (~12 seconds). This is a
7.5x improvement in build time, accelerating the CI feedback loop and the local
development loop.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
The package structure scales with the codebase because it is fractal: each new
context follows the same structure, each new aggregate within a context
follows the same structure, each new use case within an aggregate follows the
same structure. There is no point at which the structure breaks down — a
context with 50 aggregates is navigable because each aggregate is in its own
package; a context with 1 aggregate is also navigable because there is no
clutter. The module system scales the compile-time enforcement: 12 modules
today, 30 modules in the 5-year horizon (if contexts are extracted to separate
deployment units) — the module-info.java declarations scale linearly. The
ArchUnit rule count scales sub-linearly because most rules are parameterised
by context short-code (one rule that scans all contexts, not 12 rules). The main
scalability risk is package-name collisions if a new context's short-code conflicts
with an existing one — the short-code registry (maintained in ADR-005)
prevents this, and the registry is reviewed at every ADR-005 supersession.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Operations benefit from the package structure because it makes the deployed
artifact's structure visible at runtime. Stack traces show fully-qualified class
names
(com.preone.enrollment.application.enrollcmd.EnrollCommandHandlerImpl),
so an on-call engineer reading a stack trace can immediately identify which
context, layer, aggregate, and use case the failing class belongs to — no lookup
needed. Pre-v1.0 stack traces showed
com.preone.enrollment.service.EnrollService (which service? which layer?)
and required the engineer to open the IDE to identify the class's role. The
package structure also simplifies log filtering: a Grafana query for
context:enrollment filters logs by the com.preone.enrollment.* package prefix,
giving immediate visibility into one context's behaviour without querying by
endpoint or tenant. The module-info.java dependencies are operational
intelligence: an on-call engineer can read the dependency graph (auto-
generated from module-info.java files) to understand which contexts are
affected by an outage in one context — e.g., if Billing is down, the graph shows
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 141

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
that Enrollment depends on Billing's .api, so enrollment flows that charge fees
will fail.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
The flat option (no aggregate segment, rejected) was the pre-v1.0 default and
produced the 60-class domain package that was unnavigable. The argument for
it (simplicity, short names) was outweighed by the measured 80% navigation-
time cost in pre-v1.0 surveys. The feature-based option (rejected) was tempting
because it aligns with frontend conventions and vertical-slice architecture, but
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  143

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
the ARB review concluded that features cut across aggregates and would either
duplicate aggregate code or force aggregates into shared packages — both
unacceptable. DDD's aggregate-first thinking (ADR-004) is the correct
organising principle, and the chosen structure honours it. The hexagonal-
flavoured option (rejected) would have added a port/adapter segment for the
four hexagonal contexts (ADR-009), but this was rejected on uniformity
grounds: 8 of 12 contexts are not hexagonal, and a two-structure codebase
doubles the learning cost. The port/adapter distinction is already expressed
structurally (ports are interfaces in application, adapters are classes in
infrastructure) and enforced by ArchUnit; a package-name prefix would be
redundant. The chosen structure treats hexagonal as an internal concern,
invisible at the package level — which preserves uniformity while allowing the
four contexts to use hexagonal internally.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q3 2025) refactored all 12 contexts to the canonical
package structure over 4 sprints, 3 contexts per sprint. Each context migration
was a mechanical refactor: (a) move classes from ad-hoc packages
(com.preone.enrollment.service, com.preone.enrollment.services,
com.preone.enrollment.impl, com.preone.enrollment.util) into the four-layer
structure (api, application, domain, infrastructure); (b) within domain and
application, group classes by aggregate root into aggregate packages; (c)
introduce module-info.java declaring exports and requires; (d) replace *Util
and *Helper classes with proper homes (value objects, domain services, or
platform modules); (e) rename *Impl classes to either paired interface
implementations or descriptive names; (f) add ArchUnit tests for package
naming rules; (g) update imports across the codebase. Total migration: 12
engineer-weeks across Q3 2025, zero downtime (the modular monolith was
deployed continuously; the refactor was incremental and each sprint's changes
were independently deployable). The v3.0 refresh adds the sub-aggregate
package rule (a CI check that flags aggregates >15 classes without sub-
packages — currently 3 aggregates flagged, all in Enrollment, to be refactored
in Q3 2026) and the explicit module-info.java mapping (already present in v1.0
but now formally documented as part of this ADR). Rollback plan: the structure
is package-level, so rollback is mechanical (move classes back to old packages)
— but this has not been needed and is not anticipated; the v1.0 results (7.5x
faster builds, 80% faster navigation, compile-time boundary enforcement)
make rollback economically irrational.
TESTING STRATEGY
Package structure rules are tested via ArchUnit
(com.preone.architecture.PackageRulesTest) which scans all 12 contexts and
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 144

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
asserts: (a) every package matches the
<context>.<layer>[.<aggregate>[.<subaggregate>]] pattern; (b) no package
name ends with .util, .helper, .manager, .data, or .info; (c) every *Impl class has
a paired interface in the same package; (d) every context root package has a
module-info.java; (e) every module-info.java exports only the .api package; (f)
every module-info.java's requires clauses match the context's declared
dependencies (ADR-005); (g) no aggregate package exceeds 15 classes without
sub-packages. These tests run in CI on every PR and fail the build on violation.
The module system itself enforces boundaries at compile time — a cross-context
internal-package import fails to compile before ArchUnit even runs. Package-
structure compliance is reported in the architecture scorecard quarterly,
including aggregate class counts, module dependency graph changes, and any
new forbidden-suffix violations caught and fixed.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Package structure is monitored via the architecture scorecard, published
quarterly. Metrics tracked: (a) package count per context (target: stable or
growing slowly; rapid growth indicates fragmentation); (b) average classes per
package (target: 5-15; below 5 indicates over-fragmentation, above 15
indicates under-fragmentation); (c) module dependency graph complexity
(target: no context depends on more than 4 others; >4 triggers ARB review); (d)
forbidden-suffix violations caught by ArchUnit (target: zero in production;
violations in PRs are tracked as a quality metric); (e) aggregate class count
distribution (target: 80% of aggregates under 15 classes; the sub-aggregate
rule applies to the rest). Anomalies in any metric trigger a review of the
structure or its enforcement. The module dependency graph is auto-generated
and published to the architecture wiki after every release, providing a visual
audit of the platform's structural evolution.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The package structure is stable; no supersession expected. Evolution will be
additive: (a) new contexts added in future (e.g., a Curriculum context in 2027)
follow the same structure with a new short-code (cur); (b) aggregates that grow
beyond 15 classes adopt the sub-aggregate rule (already in v3.0); (c) if PreOne
extracts a context to a separate deployment unit (e.g., Notifications to a
microservice per ADR-002 future evolution), the package structure is
preserved — the module becomes a separate artifact but its internal package
structure is unchanged. The likely long-term evolution is toward a 'project'
structure (Java 21+ JEP 416: project structure for source code) if the JDK
adopts it, which would simplify module-info.java management; this is
monitored but not actioned until the JEP stabilises. The forbidden-suffix list

DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Adopt a canonical set of Java 21 coding standards for the PreOne platform
covering: records for DTOs and value objects, sealed classes for domain
hierarchies, var for local variables only, Stream API usage guidelines,
custom domain exceptions for all error paths, SLF4J parameterized logging,
null handling via Optional and empty collections, and test method naming in
the should_expected_when_condition format. Standards are enforced via
Checkstyle, SpotBugs, Error Prone, and ArchUnit in CI.

CONTEXT
Java 21 (LTS, adopted per ADR-020) introduces language features — records,
sealed classes, pattern matching for switch, text blocks — that materially
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 148

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
change how idiomatic Java is written. Pre-v1.0, the PreOne codebase targeted
Java 11 and used pre-records idioms: Lombok @Data for DTOs (with all its
downsides — reflection, IDE plugin dependency, hidden setters), abstract
classes for hierarchies (no enforcement of permitted subtypes), explicit
instanceof chains (verbose, error-prone), and String concatenation for logging
(slower than SLF4J parameterisation, susceptible to NPE). The codebase had
three competing style guides (one per feature team), 8 different exception
hierarchies (some checked, some unchecked, some mixed), and inconsistent
null-handling (some methods returned null, some Optional, some threw NPE).
The Office of the Chief Architect defined a canonical coding standard in Q3
2025 to eliminate this inconsistency. The standard had three goals: (1) adopt
Java 21 idioms where they are unambiguous improvements (records, sealed
classes, pattern matching, text blocks); (2) standardise error handling, logging,
and null-handling so that engineers can read any file and predict its
conventions; (3) make the standards mechanically enforceable so that
inconsistency is caught in CI, not in code review. The standard was drafted
through a 4-week workshop with senior engineers from each feature team,
stress-tested against real PreOne code patterns (enrollment flows, fee
calculations, notification fan-out), and validated by refactoring three reference
files per team. The v3.0 refresh adds two refinements: sealed-classes guidance
(when to use sealed interfaces vs sealed classes, and how sealed types interact
with pattern matching for switch) and pattern-matching-for-switch standards
(exhaustiveness requirements, when to use guard patterns, when to fall back to
if-else). These refinements close the last ambiguities from v1.0, where
engineers used sealed classes inconsistently (some as interfaces, some as
classes, some with permits clauses and some without) and pattern matching
was applied ad-hoc without exhaustiveness verification.

The primary driver is consistency: a canonical coding standard lets any
engineer read any file and predict its conventions, reducing cognitive load and
accelerating code review. Pre-v1.0 code review comments included 40% style
nits (why this exception type? why null here? why Lombok here?); post-v1.0,
style nits dropped to under 5% of review comments, freeing review time for
substantive design feedback. The secondary driver is Java 21 feature adoption:
records, sealed classes, and pattern matching are unambiguous improvements
over their pre-Java-17 alternatives, but only if adopted consistently. A codebase
with 50% records and 50% Lombok @Data is worse than either pure state,
because engineers must check each class's style. The standard forces full
adoption, eliminating the mixed state. The tertiary driver is tooling: Checkstyle,
SpotBugs, Error Prone, and ArchUnit can mechanically enforce most of the

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
standards, catching violations in CI rather than in review. This converts the
standard from a guideline into a constraint, which is what produces durability.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The PreOne codebase uses Java 21 but applies its features inconsistently
(records vs Lombok, sealed classes vs abstract classes, parameterized logging
vs concatenation, Optional vs null). Three competing style guides and 8
exception hierarchies produce code review noise and cognitive load. We need a
canonical coding standard that adopts Java 21 idioms, standardises
error/logging/null handling, and is mechanically enforceable via CI tooling.
CONSTRAINTS
● Standards must be enforceable by at least one of: Checkstyle,
SpotBugs, Error Prone, ArchUnit, or the javac compiler itself
● Standards must not require paid tooling (SonarQube, IntelliJ
inspections-only) — open-source CI enforcement only
● Standards must be documented with positive and negative examples
(do this, not that) for each rule
● Exceptions to standards require an ADR (not a code comment) and a
sunset date (per ADR-006 exception process)
● Standards must not contradict Java 21 idioms (e.g., cannot forbid
records or sealed classes)
● Standards must be learnable in a 2-hour onboarding session for
engineers familiar with Java 11+
ASSUMPTIONS
● Java 21 remains the LTS for the foreseeable future (next LTS: Java 25
in September 2025 — adoption planned for 2027)
● Lombok will be phased out (records replace @Data for DTOs; manual
constructors replace @AllArgsConstructor for entities)
● Engineers will accept the constraint of no Lombok (the main source of
pre-v1.0 pushback, mitigated by IntelliJ's native record support)
● Checkstyle, SpotBugs, Error Prone, and ArchUnit remain actively
maintained and Java 21-compatible
● The standard does not need to cover Kotlin or Scala (PreOne is Java-
only per ADR-020)
● Pattern matching for switch (finalised in Java 21) is stable enough to
mandate for new code

DECISION
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  152

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADOPTED
We adopt a canonical Java 21 coding standard with the following rules. (1)
Records: all DTOs (request, response, command, query) and value objects
are Java records (not Lombok @Data, not classes with manual getters);
entity classes (JPA-mapped) remain regular classes because JPA requires
no-arg constructors and mutable state. (2) Sealed classes: domain
hierarchies (e.g., EnrollmentStatus, FeeType, NotificationChannel) are
sealed interfaces with explicit permits clauses; pattern matching for switch
is used to handle all permitted subtypes, with exhaustiveness enforced by
the compiler (no default case for sealed types). (3) var: used for local
variables only (never for fields, parameters, or return types); used when the
type is obvious from the right-hand side (var list = new ArrayList<>();) or
when the type name is long (var result =
enrollmentRepository.findByStudentIdAndPeriod(...)); not used when the
type adds information (var status = getStatus(); — use EnrollmentStatus
status = getStatus(); instead). (4) Streams: used for transformation
pipelines (filter, map, collect); not used for side-effect-heavy loops (use a for
loop); not used for single-element operations (use a direct method call);
collectors.toList() returns an unmodifiable list (preferred);
Collectors.toUnmodifiableList() is explicit. (5) Exceptions: all domain errors
throw custom domain exceptions (EnrollmentNotFoundException,
FeeExceedsLimitException) extending a shared DomainException base
(unchecked, extends RuntimeException); checked exceptions are forbidden
(they force try-catch noise and do not compose with streams); exception
messages are user-actionable and include the offending value. (6) Logging:
SLF4J with parameterised messages (log.info("Enrollment created for
student {} in period {}", studentId, period);) — never string concatenation
(slower, susceptible to NPE); never log and throw (log OR throw, not both);
exception logging uses log.error("message", exception) with the exception
as the last argument. (7) Null handling: methods never return null for
collections (return empty collections); Optional<T> is used for single-value
returns that may be absent (findById returns Optional<Enrollment>);
@NonNull (Jakarta) annotates parameters and fields that must not be null;
@Nullable annotates the rare field that may be null (and the engineer must
justify it in review); fields are never left null after construction (records
enforce this via canonical constructors). (8) Testing: test method names
follow should_expectedState_when_condition format
(should_throw_when_enrollment_period_closed); test classes are named
<ClassName>Test (unit) or <ClassName>IntegrationTest (integration);
given-when-then comments structure test bodies; one assertion per test (or
one logical assertion — multiple asserts on the same object are permitted if
they verify one state).

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
DETAILED RATIONALE
The standard was chosen over the alternatives because it is the only option that
combines Java 21 feature adoption, domain-specific standards, and mechanical
enforcement. The Google Java Style Guide (rejected) is excellent for formatting
(4-space indent, brace placement, import ordering) and is adopted as a subset
for those rules, but it is deliberately feature-neutral — it does not mandate
records, sealed classes, or pattern matching, which are the core of our Java 21
adoption. Adopting Google's guide alone would leave our codebase in a mixed
state (some records, some Lombok, some abstract classes) indefinitely. The
Spring/Pivotal standards (rejected) cover framework usage well but do not
address domain modelling (DDD aggregates, value objects) or language idioms.
The no-standard option (rejected) is the pre-v1.0 state and was rejected by 92%
of engineers in survey. The records decision is the most impactful. Pre-v1.0, the
codebase had 240 Lombok @Data classes — DTOs, value objects, and
(incorrectly) JPA entities. Lombok @Data generates getters, setters, equals,
hashCode, and toString via reflection at compile time, which has four problems:
(a) it hides mutation — a DTO with @Data has setters, so callers can mutate it
after construction, producing subtle bugs in concurrent flows; (b) it requires an
IDE plugin to be readable — without the plugin, IntelliJ shows red squiggles on
every getter/setter call; (c) it couples the build to Lombok's annotation
processor, which has had compatibility issues with Java upgrades (Lombok
1.18.30 broke on Java 21's records preview); (d) it generates equals/hashCode
based on all fields, which is wrong for value objects with identity (e.g., an
Enrollment's equals should be based on EnrollmentId, not all fields). Records
solve all four: they are immutable (no setters), they are native Java (no IDE
plugin), they are compile-time (no annotation processor), and their
equals/hashCode are based on all fields by default (correct for value objects;
entities use a custom equals based on identity). The migration from Lombok
@Data to records was completed in Q4 2025 for all 240 classes; the build no
longer depends on Lombok. The sealed-classes decision addresses the pre-v1.0
pattern where domain hierarchies used abstract classes or interfaces without
enforcement of permitted subtypes. EnrollmentStatus was an interface with
three implementations (Active, Withdrawn, Pending) but nothing prevented a
fourth implementation (Cancelled) from being added in a different package,
breaking every switch statement that handled the three known cases. Sealed
interfaces with permits clauses (sealed interface EnrollmentStatus permits
Active, Withdrawn, Pending {}) constrain the hierarchy to the explicitly-
permitted subtypes; pattern matching for switch (return switch (status) { case
Active a -> ...; case Withdrawn w -> ...; case Pending p -> ...; }) is exhaustive —
if a new subtype is added to permits, every switch statement fails to compile
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 154

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
until the new case is handled. This converts a silent runtime failure (unhandled
enum value) into a compile-time error. The v3.0 refresh adds the guidance that
sealed interfaces are preferred over sealed classes (interfaces permit multiple
inheritance, classes do not) and that the permits clause should list subtypes in
the same file (not in separate files) for navigability. The var decision is the
most-debated. The argument for liberal var usage is brevity (var list = new
ArrayList<String>(); vs ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();). The
argument for conservative var usage is readability (var status =
enrollmentService.process(cmd); does not tell the reader the type of status).
The standard splits the difference: var is permitted when the type is obvious
from the right-hand side (constructor calls, literal assignments) or when the
type name is long (repository method calls returning complex generic types);
var is forbidden when the type adds information that the right-hand side does
not (method calls returning an interface type, where the reader benefits from
seeing the interface name). This is a judgement call, but the rule is documented
with examples, and Code review enforces it. The alternative (always specify the
type) is verbose and was rejected; the alternative (always use var) is opaque
and was rejected. The Stream API guidelines address a pre-v1.0 anti-pattern:
engineers used streams for everything, including side-effect-heavy loops
(stream.forEach(...)) where a for loop is clearer. The standard permits streams
for transformation pipelines (filter, map, collect — functional, no side effects)
and forbids them for side-effect-heavy loops (forEach with mutation — use a for
loop) and single-element operations (stream.of(x).findFirst() — use a direct
method call). This aligns with the Stream API's intended use (functional
transformation) and avoids the readability cost of stream misuse. The
collectors.toList() preference (returns an unmodifiable list in Java 10+) over
Collectors.toList() (returns a mutable ArrayList) is a correctness preference —
unmodifiable collections prevent accidental mutation downstream. The
exception-handling decision is structural. Domain exceptions extend a shared
DomainException (unchecked, extends RuntimeException) — checked
exceptions are forbidden because they force try-catch noise at every call site
and do not compose with streams (a stream operation that throws a checked
exception requires a try-catch wrapper, breaking the pipeline). Custom
exception classes (EnrollmentNotFoundException,
FeeExceedsLimitException) carry domain meaning — a caller catching
EnrollmentNotFoundException knows exactly what happened, versus catching
IllegalArgumentException or RuntimeException. Exception messages are user-
actionable ('Enrollment period is closed; the period 2025-Q4 ended on 2025-12-
31' vs 'Enrollment period closed') — this supports the UI's error display
(ADR-142) and the support team's debugging. The 'log OR throw, not both' rule
prevents double-handling — if an exception is thrown, the caller decides
whether to log; if it is logged and swallowed, the caller does not know it
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 155

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
happened. The logging decision is mechanical. SLF4J parameterised messages
(log.info("Enrollment created for student {} in period {}", studentId, period);)
are 10-100x faster than string concatenation (log.info("Enrollment created for
student " + studentId + " in period " + period);) because the concatenation is
avoided if the log level is disabled. They are also NPE-safe (if studentId is null,
the parameterised version logs 'null'; the concatenation version throws NPE).
The 'exception as last argument' rule (log.error("Failed to enroll student {}",
studentId, exception);) ensures the exception's stack trace is logged by SLF4J's
pattern, not toString'd into the message. Pre-v1.0, the codebase had 1,200
logging statements with string concatenation; the migration to parameterised
logging was completed in Q4 2025 and reduced log-related CPU usage by 8% in
production. The null-handling decision is the most impactful for runtime
correctness. Methods never return null for collections (return
Collections.emptyList() or List.of()) — this eliminates the 'check for null before
iterating' boilerplate that plagued pre-v1.0 code. Optional<T> is used for
single-value returns that may be absent (findById returns
Optional<Enrollment>) — callers must explicitly handle the absent case
(orElseThrow, orElse, ifPresent), eliminating the 'forgot to null-check' class of
NPE. @NonNull (Jakarta) annotates parameters and fields that must not be
null, enforced by SpotBugs at build time. @Nullable annotates the rare field
that may be null, and the engineer must justify it in review — this makes
nullability explicit rather than implicit. Records enforce non-null fields via their
canonical constructor (a record's components are non-null by default unless the
constructor explicitly assigns null). Together, these rules reduced production
NPEs by 85% in the first 6 months post-v1.0. The testing decision is structural.
Test method names in should_expectedState_when_condition format
(should_throw_when_enrollment_period_closed) are self-documenting — a test
failure report shows the method name, which describes the expected behaviour
and the condition. Pre-v1.0 test names (testEnrollment1,
testEnrollmentClosed) were opaque and required opening the test to
understand what failed. The given-when-then comment structure (// given, //
when, // then) makes the test's three phases visually distinct. The one-assertion-
per-test rule (or one logical assertion — multiple asserts on the same object
verifying one state are permitted) ensures each test verifies one behaviour,
making failures precise. This aligns with the test pyramid (ADR-146) and the
contract-testing approach (ADR-149).

DATABASE IMPACT
The coding standards have no direct database schema impact, but they shape
how JPA entities are written. Entities remain regular classes (not records)
because JPA requires no-arg constructors and mutable state; however, entity
classes follow the standard's naming and exception conventions. The
@NonNull annotation is applied to entity fields that must not be null (e.g.,
@NonNull @Column(name = "student_id") private UUID studentId;), and
SpotBugs enforces that no entity is persisted with a null @NonNull field. The
custom exception hierarchy includes a PersistenceException subfamily
(OptimisticLockException wraps JPA's OptimisticLockException to provide a
domain-meaningful message). The standards also govern Flyway migration
scripts (SQL naming per ADR-012) and the relationship between JPA entities
and domain entities (double-entity pattern per ADR-006 — domain entity is a
record or sealed class, JPA entity is a regular class, a mapper converts between
them).
API IMPACT
The coding standards directly shape the REST API surface (ADR-091). Request
and response DTOs are records (EnrollRequest, EnrollmentResponse), which
means they are immutable and serializable by Jackson without Lombok. The
custom exception hierarchy maps to HTTP status codes via a
@ExceptionHandler in each context's API layer
(EnrollmentNotFoundException -> 404, FeeExceedsLimitException -> 422,
PersistenceException -> 500), per ADR-093 (error codes). The 'log OR throw'
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 158

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
rule means a controller that catches an exception either logs it (and re-throws
for the exception handler) or throws it (and the exception handler logs it) —
never both, avoiding duplicate log entries for the same error. The SLF4J
parameterised logging rule ensures API access logs are consistent in format,
which supports log-based analytics (ADR-119).
UI IMPACT
The coding standards have no direct UI impact — the React frontend (ADR-131)
has its own TypeScript standards (separate ADR in Volume 7). However, the
API DTO record shapes directly generate the TypeScript types via OpenAPI
codegen (ADR-091), so the backend's record fields become TypeScript
interfaces. The custom exception messages (user-actionable, including
offending values) are surfaced in the UI's error toasts (ADR-142) — the
message 'Enrollment period is closed; the period 2025-Q4 ended on 2025-12-
31' is displayed to the parent verbatim, supporting the user's understanding of
what went wrong. The one-assertion-per-test rule on the backend does not
affect the UI directly, but the contract tests (ADR-149) verify that the UI's
expected response shapes match the backend's record shapes.
SECURITY IMPACT
The coding standards improve security in three ways. First, @NonNull
annotations (enforced by SpotBugs) prevent null values from reaching
database queries, eliminating a class of SQL injection where a null parameter
produces an unexpected query plan. Second, the 'log OR throw' rule and SLF4J
parameterised logging prevent sensitive data from leaking into logs — the
parameterised format (log.info("user {} logged in", userId);) logs only the
userId, not the full User object (which might contain credentials), whereas
string concatenation (log.info("user " + user);) would toString the User object.
Third, the custom exception hierarchy avoids leaking internal structure in error
messages — DomainException messages are user-facing and reviewed for
information disclosure, whereas generic RuntimeException messages (e.g.,
'NullPointerException at
com.preone.enrollment.domain.Enrollment.lambda$calculateFee$0(Enrollmen
t.java:142)') leak internal class and line numbers. The exception handler
(ADR-093) strips stack traces from API responses in production, returning only
the message and a correlation ID.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
The coding standards have measurable positive performance impact. SLF4J
parameterised logging is 10-100x faster than string concatenation when the log
level is disabled (the concatenation is avoided entirely), reducing CPU usage by
8% in production post-migration. Records are marginally faster than Lombok
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 159

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
@Data classes at instantiation (no reflection) and at equals/hashCode (JVM
inlines record component access). Sealed classes with pattern matching for
switch are as fast as traditional switch (the JVM compiles them to efficient
bytecode) and faster than instanceof chains (which require repeated type
checks). The Stream API guidelines (transformation only, not side-effect loops)
do not directly affect performance but improve readability, which reduces the
chance of performance bugs (e.g., a forEach that accidentally triggers N+1
queries). The one-assertion-per-test rule does not affect production
performance but improves test suite speed (smaller tests run faster) — the test
suite dropped from 14 minutes (pre-v1.0) to 4 minutes (post-v1.0), in part due
to smaller, more focused tests.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
The coding standards scale with the codebase because they are mechanical and
uniform. As the codebase grows from 200k LOC (current) to 1M LOC (5-year
target), the standards do not degrade — every new file follows the same rules,
enforced by the same CI tools. The tooling scales: Checkstyle, SpotBugs, Error
Prone, and ArchUnit all handle 1M LOC codebases in under 5 minutes in CI
(parallelised). The standards also scale with the team: a new engineer learns
the standards in a 2-hour onboarding session and applies them consistently
from day one, because the IDE inspections and CI enforcement catch violations
before they reach review. The main scalability risk is standard-erosion: over
time, engineers may push for exceptions (e.g., 'just this one Lombok @Data for
backward compatibility'), and accumulated exceptions can erode the standard.
This is mitigated by the ADR-006 exception process (every exception requires
an ADR with a sunset date) and by quarterly review of exceptions at the ARB.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Operations benefit from the coding standards because they produce consistent,
debuggable code. Stack traces from custom domain exceptions are
immediately meaningful (EnrollmentNotFoundException: Enrollment E-12345
not found for student S-67890) — no need to cross-reference with code to
understand what failed. Logs are structured (JSON, ADR-119) and
parameterised, so log queries (e.g., 'show me all enrollments for student
S-67890 in the last hour') return precise results without parsing free-text
messages. The 'log OR throw' rule prevents duplicate log entries for the same
error, simplifying incident analysis (one log entry per error, not two). The
exception handler (ADR-093) produces consistent API error responses
(correlation ID, error code, message), which the on-call engineer can grep for in
logs. The standards also support the on-call rotation: an on-call engineer from
any team can debug any context's code because the conventions are uniform —
they know where to find the exception definitions (com.preone.platform.errors

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
The Google Java Style Guide option (rejected as the sole standard) was adopted
as a subset for formatting rules (indent, braces, imports, line length) because it
is battle-tested and has an existing Checkstyle config. However, it was rejected
as the complete standard because it is feature-neutral — it does not mandate
records, sealed classes, or pattern matching, which are core to our Java 21
adoption. Adopting it alone would leave our codebase in a mixed state
indefinitely. The Spring/Pivotal standards option (rejected) was adopted as a
subset for Spring-specific rules (bean naming, transaction annotation
placement, repository method naming) but does not cover domain modelling or
language idioms. The no-standard option (rejected) is the pre-v1.0 state and
was rejected by 92% of engineers in survey. The chosen approach — a PreOne-
specific canonical standard that incorporates Google's formatting rules and
Spring's framework rules as subsets, and adds Java 21 idiom mandates and
domain-specific standards — is the only option that covers the full surface area
of our coding conventions while remaining mechanically enforceable.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q3-Q4 2025) refactored the codebase to comply with the
coding standards over 6 sprints. Sprint 1-2: migrate 240 Lombok @Data classes
to records (DTOs and value objects) and to regular classes (entities); remove
Lombok from pom.xml. Sprint 3: introduce sealed interfaces for domain
hierarchies (EnrollmentStatus, FeeType, NotificationChannel, etc.) and
migrate switch statements to pattern matching. Sprint 4: migrate 1,200 logging
statements from string concatenation to SLF4J parameterised. Sprint 5:
introduce custom exception hierarchy (DomainException base + per-context
subfamilies); replace generic RuntimeException throws with specific domain
exceptions. Sprint 6: add @NonNull and @Nullable annotations; fix null-return-
on-collection violations; migrate findById-style methods to return
Optional<T>. Total migration: 16 engineer-weeks across Q3-Q4 2025, zero
downtime (incremental, each sprint's changes independently deployable). The
v3.0 refresh adds the sealed-classes guidance (interfaces preferred over
classes; permits in same file) and pattern-matching-for-switch standards
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 163

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
(exhaustiveness required; guard patterns permitted for complex conditions) —
both are documentation-only, no code migration. Rollback plan: the standards
are reversible (records can be converted back to classes; parameterised
logging can be reverted to concatenation) but rollback has not been needed and
is not anticipated; the v1.0 results (8% CPU reduction from logging, 85% NPE
reduction, 40% reduction in review style nits) make rollback economically
irrational.
TESTING STRATEGY
Standards compliance is tested at three levels. (1) Compile-time enforcement:
javac enforces records' canonical constructors, sealed types' permits clauses,
and pattern-matching exhaustiveness. (2) Static analysis in CI: Checkstyle
enforces formatting rules (indent, braces, imports, line length, naming);
SpotBugs enforces null-handling (@NonNull violations, null return on
collections), logging rules (no concatenation in log statements), and exception
rules (no checked exceptions); Error Prone enforces equals/hashCode
correctness, stream misuse, and common bug patterns; ArchUnit enforces
layer-specific class types (controllers in api, entities in domain, repositories in
infrastructure) and exception hierarchy (all domain exceptions extend
DomainException). (3) Code review: judgement-call rules (var usage, one-
assertion-per-test, given-when-then structure) are enforced by reviewers using
a rubric. Standards compliance is reported in the architecture scorecard
quarterly, including: Checkstyle violation count (target: zero in production),
SpotBugs violation count (target: zero), Error Prone violation count (target:
zero), @SuppressWarnings count (target: <5 per context, each justified), and
review-rubric adherence (target: >90% of reviews follow the rubric).
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Standards compliance is monitored via the architecture scorecard, published
quarterly. Metrics tracked: (a) Checkstyle/SpotBugs/Error Prone violation
count per context (target: zero in production; PR-time violations tracked as a
quality metric); (b) record adoption rate (target: 100% of DTOs and value
objects are records; entities are regular classes); (c) sealed-type adoption rate
(target: 100% of domain hierarchies are sealed); (d) parameterised logging
adoption rate (target: 100% of log statements use SLF4J parameterisation; pre-
v1.0 was 35%); (e) custom exception adoption rate (target: 100% of thrown
exceptions extend DomainException; pre-v1.0 was 60%); (f)
@NonNull/@Nullable annotation coverage (target: >95% of parameters and
fields annotated); (g) test method naming compliance (target: 100% of test
methods follow should_X_when_Y format). Anomalies in any metric trigger a
review of the standard or its enforcement. Production NPE rate is tracked as a

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
downstream metric (target: <1 NPE per 10,000 requests; pre-v1.0 was 7 per
10,000).
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The coding standards are stable; no supersession expected until the next Java
LTS (Java 25, September 2025 — adoption planned for 2027). Evolution will be
triggered by: (a) Java 25 adoption — a v-next of this ADR will add standards for
Java 25 features (e.g., structured concurrency, scoped values, flexible
constructor bodies); (b) new language features in Java 21 point releases (e.g., if
a future Java 21.x stabilises a preview feature); (c) erosion of specific standards
(if a standard is consistently bypassed via exceptions, it is a candidate for
revision or removal). The likely long-term evolution is toward more aggressive
adoption of functional patterns (pattern matching, sealed types, records) as the
team's familiarity grows — the v3.0 refresh already adds pattern-matching-for-
switch standards that v1.0 did not cover. The Lombok removal is permanent; no
future re-adoption is contemplated. The custom exception hierarchy may grow
to include new subfamilies (e.g., IntegrationException for adapter failures in
hexagonal contexts per ADR-009) — these additions are additive and do not
require supersession.

DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Adopt a canonical naming standard across all layers of the PreOne platform:
classes follow AggregateRoot/Command/Event/Repository suffix
conventions; methods use verbs for commands, findByX for queries,
isX/hasX for booleans; variables use camelCase with no abbreviations;
database objects use snake_case with singular table names and
created_at/updated_at audit columns; API URLs use kebab-case with
versioned path prefixes (/api/v1/academic-years). Forbidden suffixes
(Manager, Helper, Util, Data, Info) eliminate the pre-v1.0 dumping-ground
classes. Standards are enforced via Checkstyle naming rules, ArchUnit
class-name patterns, and Flyway/Liquibase migration naming checks.

Review Cadence Annual review or when a new
naming surface is introduced (e.g.,
GraphQL, gRPC)
Supersedes None (v1.0 original; v3.0 refresh
adds the aggregate-root suffix
mandate and the database index
naming convention)
CONTEXT
Naming is the most visible and most argued-over aspect of a codebase. Pre-
v1.0, the PreOne codebase had no naming standard, and the result was chaos:
the same concept was named four different ways (EnrollmentService,
EnrollmentManager, EnrollmentHelper, EnrollmentUtil — four classes, four
suffixes, all doing roughly the same thing or, worse, slightly different things).
Method names were inconsistent (findEnrollment, getEnrollment,
fetchEnrollment, retrieveEnrollment — all synonyms, none indicating whether
null or Optional was returned). Variable names used abbreviations (enr for
enrollment, std for student, grd for guardian) that were intelligible only to the
original author. Database tables were plural (enrollments, students, guardians)
but columns were singular snake_case (student_id, enrollment_date) — a mix
that broke PostgreSQL's default naming conventions and required @Table and
@Column annotations on every JPA entity. API URLs used camelCase
(/api/v1/academicYears) which broke REST conventions and required explicit
@RequestMapping mappings. The Office of the Chief Architect defined a
canonical naming standard in Q3 2025 to eliminate this inconsistency. The
standard had three goals: (1) every name should be self-describing — an
engineer seeing EnrollmentAggregateRoot, EnrollCommand, or
EnrollmentCreatedEvent should immediately know the class's role without
reading its body; (2) names should be consistent across layers — the Enrollment
concept is named 'enrollment' in the database (enr_enrollments table), in the
API (/api/v1/enrollments), in the package (com.preone.enrollment), and in the
class (EnrollmentAggregateRoot); (3) forbidden suffixes (Manager, Helper,
Util, Data, Info) should eliminate the dumping-ground classes that accumulated
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 168

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
cross-cutting responsibilities in pre-v1.0. The v3.0 refresh adds two
refinements: the aggregate-root suffix mandate (aggregate root classes are
named <Aggregate>AggregateRoot, not just <Aggregate>, to distinguish
them from entities and value objects) and the database index naming
convention (indexes are named idx_<table>_<columns> for non-unique and
uq_<table>_<columns> for unique, replacing the pre-v1.0 ad-hoc index names
that were unreadable in query plans).
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary driver is searchability: a canonical naming standard lets engineers
search the codebase confidently. A search for 'EnrollCommand' finds the
command class in the application layer; a search for 'enr_enrollments' finds the
table; a search for '/api/v1/enrollments' finds the API endpoint. Pre-v1.0, the
same concept had four names, and engineers had to guess which to search for,
often missing relevant code. The secondary driver is onboarding: a new
engineer can infer a class's role from its name (EnrollmentAggregateRoot is the
aggregate root; EnrollCommand is the command; EnrollmentCreatedEvent is
the domain event) without reading the class body or consulting documentation.
This compresses onboarding from '3 days to understand the naming
conventions' (pre-v1.0) to '30 minutes' (post-v1.0). The tertiary driver is tooling:
Checkstyle, ArchUnit, Flyway, and OpenAPI codegen can enforce and leverage
naming standards — Checkstyle validates class and method names; ArchUnit
validates that aggregate roots are named *AggregateRoot; Flyway validates
migration file names; OpenAPI codegen generates TypeScript types from the
API DTO record names. Without a standard, these tools cannot enforce or
leverage naming, and the codebase degrades to ad-hoc.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The PreOne codebase has no naming standard, leading to inconsistency (four
names for one concept), ambiguity (cannot infer a class's role from its name),
and forbidden-suffix dumping grounds (Manager, Helper, Util classes
accumulating cross-cutting responsibilities). We need a canonical naming
standard that is self-describing, consistent across layers, mechanically
enforceable, and forbids the patterns that produced the pre-v1.0 mess.
CONSTRAINTS
● Names must be self-describing — an engineer should infer the class's
role from the name alone
● Names must be consistent across layers — the same concept uses the
same root name in DB, API, package, and class
● Names must be mechanically enforceable — Checkstyle, ArchUnit,
Flyway, or OpenAPI tooling must validate them
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 169

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
● Names must follow Java conventions (camelCase for
classes/methods/variables, UPPER_SNAKE for constants)
● Names must follow PostgreSQL conventions (snake_case for
tables/columns, lowercase, no reserved words)
● Names must follow REST conventions (kebab-case for URLs, plural for
collections, singular for items)
● Forbidden suffixes (Manager, Helper, Util, Data, Info) must be
eliminated across the codebase
ASSUMPTIONS
● The DDD aggregate-root convention (suffix AggregateRoot) is more
valuable than brevity (the pre-v1.0 convention was no suffix)
● Engineers will accept the constraint of no abbreviations (the main
source of pre-v1.0 pushback, mitigated by IDE auto-completion)
● PostgreSQL's snake_case convention is the correct database convention
(no camelCase-in-DB via JPA naming strategy)
● REST kebab-case URLs are the correct API convention (consistent with
HTTP standards and major API providers)
● The naming standard does not need to cover GraphQL or gRPC (not in
scope per ADR-020)
● OpenAPI codegen can be configured to generate TypeScript types from
record names without modification

DECISION

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADOPTED
We adopt a canonical naming standard with the following rules. (1) Class
naming: aggregate roots are named <Aggregate>AggregateRoot (e.g.,
EnrollmentAggregateRoot); entities (non-root) are named <Entity> (e.g.,
EnrollmentLineItem); value objects are named <ValueObject> (e.g.,
EnrollmentPeriod); commands are named <Action>Command (e.g.,
EnrollCommand); queries are named <Query>Query (e.g.,
GetEnrollmentQuery); domain events are named
<Aggregate><Action>Event (e.g., EnrollmentCreatedEvent); repositories
are named <Aggregate>Repository (e.g., EnrollmentRepository); use case
handlers are named <Command>Handler (e.g., EnrollCommandHandler);
controllers are named <Resource>Controller (e.g., EnrollmentController);
DTOs are named <Resource><Role>Dto or <Resource><Role>View (e.g.,
EnrollmentRequestDto, EnrollmentResponseView); exceptions are named
<Condition>Exception (e.g., EnrollmentNotFoundException). (2) Method
naming: command methods use verbs (enroll, withdraw, transfer); query
methods use findByX, getX, countByX, existsByX (Spring Data convention);
boolean methods use isX (isActive) or hasX (hasEnrollments); factory
methods use of or from (EnrollmentId.of(uuid)); conversion methods use
toX (toDto, toEntity); the method name should describe the action, not the
implementation. (3) Variable naming: camelCase, no abbreviations
(enrollment, not enr; student, not std; guardian, not grd); loop variables use
the singular of the collection (for (Student student : students)); constants
use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (MAX_ENROLLMENT_CAPACITY); fields use
the same camelCase as local variables. (4) Database naming: tables are
snake_case, singular, prefixed with context short-code (enr_enrollment,
enr_enrollment_line_item — singular table names even though they hold
multiple rows); columns are snake_case (student_id, enrollment_date,
created_at); primary keys are <table_singular>_id (enrollment_id) or id for
simple tables; foreign keys are <referenced_table_singular>_id (student_id
references stu_student); audit columns are created_at, updated_at,
created_by, updated_by, deleted_at (soft delete per ADR-047); indexes are
idx_<table>_<columns> (non-unique) or uq_<table>_<columns>
(unique); constraints are pk_<table>, fk_<table>_<referenced>,
ck_<table>_<description> (check). (5) API naming: URLs are kebab-case
(/api/v1/academic-years, not /api/v1/academicYears); collections are plural
(/api/v1/enrollments); items are singular via path parameter
(/api/v1/enrollments/{id}); query parameters are camelCase (studentId,
enrollmentDate) to match JavaScript conventions; path parameters are
camelCase ({enrollmentId}); HTTP methods follow REST conventions (GET
for queries, POST for commands, PUT/PATCH for updates, DELETE for
deletes). (6) Forbidden suffixes: no class or package may end with Manager,
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 172

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
Helper, Util, Data, Info, or Processor (except where Processor is a domain-
meaningful term like PaymentProcessor); these are replaced with role-
specific names (NotificationDispatcher, FeeCalculator,
EnrollmentRepository).
DETAILED RATIONALE
The canonical naming standard was chosen over the alternatives because it is
the only option that achieves cross-layer consistency, self-description, and
mechanical enforcement simultaneously. The Java/Jakarta default (rejected) is
the pre-v1.0 state and was rejected by 88% of engineers. The Spring Data
naming conventions (rejected as the sole standard) are excellent for repository
methods (findByX, countByX) and are adopted as a subset, but they do not cover
domain classes, API URLs, or database tables. The Hungarian notation
(rejected) is outdated and violates Java conventions. The chosen standard
incorporates Spring Data's repository conventions as a subset and adds the
cross-layer consistency and forbidden-suffix rules that the alternatives lack.
The aggregate-root suffix mandate (added in v3.0) is the most-debated rule.
Pre-v1.0, the aggregate root class was named Enrollment — short, clean, and
indistinguishable from the entity, the value object, the DTO, and the table.
Engineers had to read the class body to determine its role. The v3.0 mandate
(EnrollmentAggregateRoot) makes the role explicit in the name. The argument
against (length, verbosity) is outweighed by the clarity gain: an engineer seeing
EnrollmentAggregateRoot, EnrollmentLineItem, EnrollmentPeriod,
EnrollmentRequestDto, and enr_enrollment in the same file immediately
understands the role of each. The IDE's auto-completion mitigates the typing
cost. The alternative (no suffix, rely on package location) was rejected because
package location is not visible in stack traces, log messages, or search results
— the name is the only universally visible identifier. The command/event
naming conventions (EnrollCommand, EnrollmentCreatedEvent) follow DDD
patterns (ADR-004). Commands are imperatives (Enroll, Withdraw, Transfer) —
they describe the action to take. Events are past-tense (EnrollmentCreated,
EnrollmentWithdrawn) — they describe what happened. This distinction is
critical for readability: a class named EnrollmentCreated is ambiguous (is it a
command to create, or an event that was created?), while
EnrollmentCreatedEvent is unambiguous. The Handler suffix
(EnrollCommandHandler) follows the command-handler pattern and is
consistent with the Spring/CQRS convention. Pre-v1.0, handlers were named
EnrollmentService (vague — service for what?) or EnrollService (slightly
better, but still not indicating it handles a command); the v1.0 standard
mandates the Handler suffix for clarity. The method naming conventions are
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 173

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
designed to make the method's contract visible in its name. Command methods
use verbs (enroll, withdraw) — they perform an action and may throw. Query
methods use findByX (returns Optional or may throw NotFound), getX (returns
non-null or throws), countByX (returns long), existsByX (returns boolean) — the
prefix indicates the return behaviour. Boolean methods use isX (isActive —
property of the object) or hasX (hasEnrollments — relationship to other
objects). This distinction matters for readability: isActive() reads as 'is this
active?' (a property), while hasEnrollments() reads as 'does this have
enrollments?' (a relationship). Pre-v1.0, boolean methods were named
inconsistently (active(), enrolled(), withEnrollments()), making their return
type and meaning ambiguous. The variable naming rule (no abbreviations) is
the most-debated. Pre-v1.0, the codebase had enr (enrollment), std (student),
grd (guardian), tch (teacher), cls (class), sec (section), att (attendance), bil
(billing) — eight abbreviations, each used inconsistently (sometimes enr meant
enrollment, sometimes enrolled). The no-abbreviations rule eliminates this
ambiguity at the cost of more typing (enrollment vs enr). The typing cost is
mitigated by IDE auto-completion (type 'enr' + Tab -> 'enrollment'). The
readability gain is substantial: an engineer reading 'for (Enrollment
enrollment : enrollments)' immediately understands the loop, versus 'for (Enr
enr : enrs)' which requires cross-referencing the variable declaration. The
constant naming rule (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE) follows Java convention and is
enforced by Checkstyle. The database naming convention (snake_case,
singular tables, prefixed with context short-code) aligns with PostgreSQL
conventions and with the package structure (ADR-010). Singular table names
(enr_enrollment, not enr_enrollments) is a deliberate choice: a table holds
multiple rows, but each row represents one entity, and the table name
describes the entity (singular), not the collection (plural). This is the
ActiveRecord and Django convention; it makes the table-to-entity mapping
obvious (enr_enrollment <-> Enrollment JPA entity). The pre-v1.0 plural
convention (enrollments) required @Table(name = "enrollments") on every
entity and broke PostgreSQL's default naming strategy. The audit column
convention (created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by, deleted_at) is
standard (Rails, Django, Hibernate Envers) and is enforced by a Flyway
migration template. The index naming convention (idx_<table>_<columns>,
uq_<table>_<columns>) makes indexes identifiable in query plans — a slow
query showing 'Index Scan using idx_enr_enrollment_student_id' is
immediately clear, versus 'Index Scan using enrollment_student_id_idx' (pre-
v1.0 convention, inconsistent). The API naming convention (kebab-case URLs)
follows REST and HTTP standards. Kebab-case (/api/v1/academic-years) is the
convention used by major API providers (GitHub, Stripe, AWS) because it is
case-insensitive (no ambiguity between academicYears and academicyears),
URL-safe (no encoding needed), and readable. Pre-v1.0 camelCase URLs
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 174

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
(/api/v1/academicYears) required explicit @RequestMapping mappings and
broke REST conventions. The plural-collection, singular-item convention
(/api/v1/enrollments, /api/v1/enrollments/{id}) is standard REST. The query
parameter camelCase convention (studentId, not student_id) matches
JavaScript conventions (camelCase is the JS standard) and avoids the
underscore-vs-camelCase mismatch at the API-to-frontend boundary. The path
parameter camelCase convention ({enrollmentId}) matches the query
parameter convention for consistency. The forbidden-suffix list (Manager,
Helper, Util, Data, Info, Processor) is the same as in ADR-010 (package
structure) and ADR-011 (coding standards), applied to class names. The
replacement is role-specific names: NotificationDispatcher (not
NotificationManager), FeeCalculator (not FeeHelper), EnrollmentRepository
(not EnrollmentUtil), EnrollmentRequestDto (not EnrollmentData),
EnrollmentSummaryView (not EnrollmentInfo). The Processor exception
(PaymentProcessor is permitted because 'processor' is a domain-meaningful
term for payment processing) is a narrowly-scoped carve-out, reviewed case-
by-case. Pre-v1.0, the codebase had 14 *Util, 8 *Helper, 6 *Manager, 11 *Data,
and 9 *Info classes — 48 dumping-ground classes that were refactored to role-
specific names in Q3-Q4 2025. The most likely counter-argument is that the
standard is over-specified and leaves no room for engineer judgement. The
counter-counter-argument is the same as for ADR-010 and ADR-011: the
standard specifies names, not design — engineers retain full freedom on class
design, method bodies, and internal logic. The standard removes only the
decisions that should not be left to engineer preference (what suffix for this
class? camelCase or snake_case for this column?) because those decisions,
made inconsistently, produce the pre-v1.0 mess. The measured productivity
impact (search time down 70%, onboarding time down 80%, review style nits
down 60%) justifies the constraint.

DATABASE IMPACT
The database naming standard directly shapes the PostgreSQL schema
(ADR-041). Tables are snake_case, singular, prefixed with the context short-
code (enr_enrollment, stu_student, bill_charge, att_attendance, ntf_message).
Columns are snake_case (student_id, enrollment_date, created_at, updated_at,
deleted_at). Primary keys are <table_singular>_id (enrollment_id) or id for
simple tables. Foreign keys are <referenced_table_singular>_id (student_id
references stu_student). Indexes are idx_<table>_<columns>
(idx_enr_enrollment_student_id) or uq_<table>_<columns>
(uq_enr_enrollment_student_period). Constraints are pk_<table>,
fk_<table>_<referenced>, ck_<table>_<description>. Audit columns
(created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by, deleted_at) are present on
every table, enforced by a Flyway migration template. The JPA naming strategy
(SpringPhysicalNamingStrategy) maps camelCase Java fields (studentId) to
snake_case columns (student_id) automatically, so entities do not need
@Column annotations for naming — only for constraints (@Column(nullable =
false, length = 100)). This convention is enforced by Flyway migration naming
checks in CI: a migration that creates a table not matching the pattern fails the
build.
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 177

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
API IMPACT
The API naming standard directly shapes the REST API surface (ADR-091).
URLs are kebab-case (/api/v1/academic-years, /api/v1/enrollments,
/api/v1/billing/charges). Collections are plural (/api/v1/enrollments); items are
singular via path parameter (/api/v1/enrollments/{enrollmentId}). Query
parameters are camelCase (studentId, enrollmentDate, pageNumber,
pageSize). Path parameters are camelCase ({enrollmentId}, {studentId}).
HTTP methods follow REST conventions (GET for queries, POST for commands,
PUT/PATCH for updates, DELETE for deletes). The OpenAPI spec (ADR-091) is
the source of truth for API naming; OpenAPI lint in CI validates that every path
is kebab-case, every parameter is camelCase, and every collection is plural. The
TypeScript SDK generated from OpenAPI uses the record names
(EnrollmentRequestDto -> EnrollmentRequestDto interface in TypeScript), so
the backend-to-frontend naming is consistent. Pre-v1.0, API URLs were
camelCase and required explicit @RequestMapping annotations; the kebab-
case convention allows Spring's path-matching to work without annotations
(using @PathVariable and @GetMapping with kebab-case paths).
UI IMPACT
The naming standard has indirect UI impact via the generated TypeScript SDK.
The React frontend (ADR-131) imports types from the SDK
(EnrollmentRequestDto, EnrollmentResponseView), so the backend's class
names become the frontend's type names. This consistency means a UI
engineer working with Enrollment data sees the same names as the backend
engineer — no mental translation between 'Enrollment' (backend) and
'EnrollmentModel' (frontend). The API URL kebab-case convention
(/api/v1/academic-years) is transparent to the UI because the SDK abstracts the
URL; the UI calls sdk.enrollments.list() and the SDK constructs the GET
/api/v1/enrollments request. The query parameter camelCase convention
(studentId) matches JavaScript conventions, so the SDK's parameter objects
(sdk.enrollments.list({ studentId: '...' })) feel natural to JS engineers. The UI's
own naming conventions (React component naming, TypeScript interface
naming) are governed by ADR-131 (frontend architecture) and align with the
backend's conventions for symmetry.
SECURITY IMPACT
The naming standard improves security indirectly by making the codebase
more auditable. Consistent naming (every aggregate root is *AggregateRoot,
every repository is *Repository) lets security reviewers and SAST tools locate
security-relevant classes by name pattern — a reviewer can grep for
*Repository to find all data access points, or grep for *Controller to find all API
entry points. The forbidden-suffix list (no *Manager, *Helper, *Util) eliminates
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 178

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
the dumping-ground classes that historically accumulated cross-cutting
responsibilities (including security-relevant ones like authentication,
authorisation, and encryption) without clear ownership — pre-v1.0, the
AuthHelper class was the dumping ground for all auth logic, and a security
review of it found three vulnerabilities (one CSRF, one timing attack, one
insecure random) that were obscured by the class's catch-all nature. Post-v1.0,
auth logic is split into AuthenticationProvider, AuthorizationService, and
TokenValidator — each role-specific, each independently auditable. The audit
column convention (created_by, updated_by) supports compliance audits (who
changed this record?) required by DPDP Act 2023.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
The naming standard has negligible runtime performance impact — names are
compile-time concepts; at runtime, the JVM sees resolved symbols. The
database naming standard (snake_case, singular tables) has a small positive
impact on PostgreSQL query planning: PostgreSQL's default naming strategy
assumes snake_case, so conformant names avoid the parser overhead of case-
folding (camelCase names are case-folded to lowercase by PostgreSQL, which
adds a small cost per query). The index naming convention
(idx_<table>_<columns>) does not affect query performance but makes
EXPLAIN output more readable, which improves query-tuning productivity — a
DBA seeing 'Index Scan using idx_enr_enrollment_student_id' immediately
knows the index, versus 'Index Scan using enrollment_student_id_idx' (pre-
v1.0, inconsistent). The API URL kebab-case convention has no performance
impact (URLs are parsed once per request). The overall performance impact is
neutral to slightly positive, with the main benefit being developer productivity
in query tuning and debugging.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
The naming standard scales with the codebase because it is mechanical and
uniform. As the codebase grows from 200k LOC (current) to 1M LOC (5-year
target), the standard does not degrade — every new class, table, and URL
follows the same rules, enforced by the same CI tools. The tooling scales:
Checkstyle, ArchUnit, Flyway, and OpenAPI lint all handle 1M LOC codebases
and 1,000-table schemas in under 5 minutes in CI. The standard also scales
with the team: a new engineer learns the naming conventions in a 1-hour
onboarding session (less than the 2-hour coding standards session, because
naming is a subset of coding standards) and applies them consistently from day
one, because IDE inspections and CI enforcement catch violations before they
reach review. The main scalability risk is name collisions: as the codebase
grows, two aggregates in different contexts may want the same name (e.g., a
Notification context's Message and a Communication context's Message). This
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 179

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
is mitigated by the context short-code prefix (ntf_message vs com_message) at
the   database   level,   and   by   the   package   structure
| (com.preone.notification.domain.message |     |     |     | vs  |
| --------------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
com.preone.communication.domain.message) at the code level. Cross-context
name collisions are reviewed at the ARB when a new context is added.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Operations benefit from the naming standard because it makes the deployed
artifact's structure visible at runtime, consistent with ADR-010 (package
structure). Stack traces show fully-qualified class names that include the role
(com.preone.enrollment.domain.enrollment.EnrollmentAggregateRoot), so an
on-call engineer immediately knows the failing class is an aggregate root in the
domain layer — no lookup needed. Log messages reference class names
consistently, so a Grafana query for 'EnrollmentAggregateRoot' finds all log
entries related to enrollment aggregate operations. Database query plans show
index   names   (idx_enr_enrollment_student_id)   that   are   immediately
interpretable, accelerating query tuning. API access logs show kebab-case
URLs   (/api/v1/enrollments)   that   are   consistent   with   the   OpenAPI
documentation, so an on-call engineer can correlate a log entry with the API
spec   without   translation.   The   audit   columns   (created_at,   updated_at,
created_by, updated_by) support compliance queries ('who changed this
enrollment on 2025-12-15?') that are required by DPDP Act 2023 and by
internal audit. The consistency of naming across DB, API, code, and logs
reduces the cognitive load on on-call engineers, who may be debugging an
unfamiliar context — the conventions are uniform, so the engineer can navigate
any   context's   code,   schema,   and   API   without   learning   context-specific
conventions.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
The Java/Jakarta default option (rejected) is the pre-v1.0 state and was rejected
by 88% of engineers. The Spring Data naming conventions option (rejected as
the sole standard) was adopted as a subset for repository method naming
(findByX, countByX, existsByX) because it is excellent and battle-tested, but it
does not cover domain classes, API URLs, or database tables. The Hungarian
notation option (rejected) is outdated and violates Java conventions; it was
rejected unanimously in the engineering survey. The chosen approach — a
PreOne-specific canonical standard that incorporates Spring Data's repository
conventions as a subset and adds cross-layer consistency, forbidden-suffix
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  182

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
rules, and database/API naming conventions — is the only option that covers
the full surface area of naming across DB, API, code, and UI. The aggregate-
root suffix mandate (EnrollmentAggregateRoot vs Enrollment) was the most-
debated rule; the v3.0 decision to mandate it (vs v1.0's recommendation) was
driven by the measured 30% reduction in 'what is this class?' questions in code
review post-v1.0 (where the suffix was recommended but not enforced). The
singular-table-name convention (enr_enrollment vs enr_enrollments) was the
second most-debated; the decision to use singular aligns with the
ActiveRecord/Django convention and with the entity-to-table mapping clarity,
and was validated by the JPA Buddy IDE plugin's automatic handling of the
mapping.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q3-Q4 2025) refactored the codebase to comply with the
naming standard over 5 sprints. Sprint 1: rename 14 *Util, 8 *Helper, 6
*Manager, 11 *Data, and 9 *Info classes to role-specific names
(EnrollmentRepository, FeeCalculator, NotificationDispatcher,
EnrollmentRequestDto, EnrollmentSummaryView). Sprint 2: add the
AggregateRoot suffix to all aggregate root classes (Enrollment ->
EnrollmentAggregateRoot); update all references. Sprint 3: rename command,
query, event, and handler classes to the standard convention (EnrollCommand,
GetEnrollmentQuery, EnrollmentCreatedEvent, EnrollCommandHandler).
Sprint 4: rename database tables from plural to singular (enrollments ->
enr_enrollment); rename columns from camelCase to snake_case where
needed; rename indexes to idx_/uq_ convention; add audit columns where
missing. Sprint 5: rename API URLs from camelCase to kebab-case
(/api/v1/academicYears -> /api/v1/academic-years); update OpenAPI spec;
regenerate TypeScript SDK. Total migration: 14 engineer-weeks across Q3-Q4
2025, zero downtime (the modular monolith was deployed continuously; the
database renames were applied via Flyway migrations with backward-
compatible views during the transition). The v3.0 refresh adds the aggregate-
root suffix mandate (already recommended in v1.0, now enforced by ArchUnit)
and the database index naming convention (already in v1.0 Flyway template,
now formally documented in this ADR). Rollback plan: the standard is
reversible (classes can be renamed back; tables can be renamed back) but
rollback has not been needed and is not anticipated; the v1.0 results (70%
faster search, 80% faster onboarding, 60% fewer review style nits) make
rollback economically irrational.
TESTING STRATEGY
Naming standard compliance is tested at four levels. (1) Checkstyle: enforces
class name patterns (*AggregateRoot, *Command, *Event, *Repository,
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 183

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
*Handler, *Controller, *Dto, *View, *Exception), method name patterns
(findByX, getX, countByX, existsByX, isX, hasX), variable name rules
(camelCase, no abbreviations, min 3 chars except loop counters), and constant
name rules (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE). (2) ArchUnit: enforces that aggregate
roots are named *AggregateRoot and are in *.domain.* packages; that
controllers are named *Controller and are in *.api.* packages; that repositories
are named *Repository and are in *.application.* (port) or *.infrastructure.*
(implementation) packages; that no class name ends with a forbidden suffix. (3)
Flyway migration checks: enforces that table names match the pattern
<ctx>_<singular>, that column names are snake_case, that index names
match idx_/uq_ patterns, that audit columns are present, and that migration file
names match V<date>__<ctx>_<desc>.sql. (4) OpenAPI lint: enforces that API
paths are kebab-case, that collections are plural, that parameters are
camelCase, and that HTTP methods follow REST conventions. All checks run in
CI on every PR and fail the build on violation. Naming compliance is reported in
the architecture scorecard quarterly, including: forbidden-suffix violation count
(target: zero in production), aggregate-root suffix adoption rate (target: 100%),
singular-table-name adoption rate (target: 100%), kebab-case URL adoption
rate (target: 100%).
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Naming standard compliance is monitored via the architecture scorecard,
published quarterly. Metrics tracked: (a) Checkstyle naming violation count per
context (target: zero in production; PR-time violations tracked as a quality
metric); (b) forbidden-suffix violation count (target: zero; pre-v1.0 had 48
violations, all resolved in Q3-Q4 2025); (c) aggregate-root suffix adoption rate
(target: 100%; pre-v1.0 was 0%, v1.0 was 85% recommended, v3.0 is 100%
mandated); (d) singular-table-name adoption rate (target: 100%; pre-v1.0 was
0%, v1.0 was 100%); (e) kebab-case URL adoption rate (target: 100%; pre-v1.0
was 0%, v1.0 was 100%); (f) audit column coverage (target: 100% of tables have
created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by, deleted_at; pre-v1.0 was 70%,
v1.0 was 100%); (g) index naming compliance (target: 100% of indexes match
idx_/uq_ pattern; pre-v1.0 was 30%, v1.0 was 100%). Anomalies in any metric
trigger a review of the standard or its enforcement. Downstream metrics
(search time, onboarding time, review style nits) are tracked in the developer
productivity scorecard, published quarterly.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The naming standard is stable; no supersession expected. Evolution will be
triggered by: (a) introduction of a new naming surface (e.g., GraphQL types,
gRPC service names) — a v-next of this ADR would add conventions for the new
surface; (b) Java language evolution (e.g., if a future Java introduces record
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 184

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
patterns that affect naming, the standard would be updated); (c) PostgreSQL
evolution (e.g., if PostgreSQL changes its identifier length limit, the index
naming convention may need adjustment); (d) consistency erosion (if a specific
rule is consistently bypassed via exceptions, it is a candidate for revision). The
likely long-term evolution is toward more aggressive automation — OpenAPI
codegen currently generates TypeScript types from record names; a future
evolution could generate the entire SDK (types, client, hooks) from the
OpenAPI spec, eliminating manual SDK maintenance. The aggregate-root suffix
mandate (v3.0) may be revisited if Java introduces a native 'aggregate' concept
(unlikely in the foreseeable future). The forbidden-suffix list may expand (e.g.,
adding *Service if it accumulates dumping-ground behaviour, though *Service
is currently permitted for application-layer services that are not use case
handlers).

DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Adopt a monorepo at /preone with five top-level directories — /backend,
/frontend, /infra, /docs, /scripts — and a Gradle multi-project backend that
maps one subproject per bounded context. Backend modules follow the
/preone/backend/<module>/<layer>/<aggregate> hierarchy defined by
ADR-010, the shared kernel lives at /preone/backend/shared, and the
frontend mirrors modules at /preone/frontend/src/<module>/<component-
type>. New modules are added through a scaffold script that generates the
layer skeleton, registers the Gradle subproject, declares module-info.java,
and adds ArchUnit rules in a single command.

CONTEXT
Before v1.0, the PreOne codebase lived in a single Spring Boot project with a
flat package structure — com.preone.app — and a sibling Git repository for the
React frontend, plus a third repository for Terraform, a fourth for
documentation, and a fifth for build scripts. Cross-repository changes (e.g.,
adding a new module that touched backend, frontend, infra, and docs) required
five pull requests across five repos, five CI runs, and a manual tag-coordination
step before deployment. The team measured the cost: a typical cross-cutting
feature (add a new domain entity, expose it via API, build the UI, deploy the
table migration, document the endpoint) took 6-9 days end-to-end, of which 4-5
days were coordination overhead — not engineering work. The team evaluated
three structural alternatives during the v1.0 architecture reset: keep the
polyrepo structure with better automation; merge backend and frontend into
one repo but keep infra/docs/scripts separate; or consolidate everything into a
single monorepo. The evaluation concluded that the coordination cost was
structural, not tooling-related: the five repos were out of sync because they
changed at different rates and the human coordination step was the bottleneck,
not the merge process. A monorepo eliminates the coordination step by making
cross-cutting changes atomic — one PR touches backend, frontend, infra, and
docs together, and CI verifies the cross-references in a single run. The internal
structure of the monorepo reflects the architectural decisions already made:
ADR-002 (Modular Monolith) requires that each bounded context be a clearly-
separable module; ADR-003 (Clean Architecture) requires that each module
have four layers; ADR-004 (DDD) requires that each module's Domain layer
contain its aggregates; ADR-010 (Package Structure) defines the exact package
naming convention. This ADR (ADR-013) defines the directory structure that
hosts these decisions on the filesystem — the physical layout that makes the
logical architecture visible at a glance. A new engineer should be able to
navigate the repository structure and predict where any class lives, without
reading documentation, because the structure mirrors the architecture.

BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary business driver is delivery velocity: a monorepo with a one-PR-per-
feature workflow compresses cross-cutting feature delivery from 6-9 days to 2-
3 days. The 50-65% reduction in cycle time compounds across the 40-engineer
organisation into roughly 8,000-10,000 engineer-hours per year reclaimed from
coordination overhead. This is the single largest velocity lever available without
hiring. The secondary driver is architectural coherence: when backend,
frontend, infra, and docs live in the same repo, a change to the API contract is
forced to update the frontend call site, the Terraform output (if the API is
exposed via a gateway), and the OpenAPI documentation in the same PR. The
pre-v1.0 polyrepo model produced drift — the OpenAPI spec in /docs was
routinely 2-3 sprints behind the actual backend, and the frontend called
endpoints that no longer existed in the backend. The monorepo eliminates drift
by making cross-references atomic. The tertiary driver is onboarding: a new
engineer clones one repository and has the entire system — code,
infrastructure, documentation, build scripts — in one working tree. The
cognitive cost of 'where does X live?' is reduced to a single `find` or a single
`grep` against one tree, rather than five. Onboarding surveys measured the
'time to first PR' for new engineers at 3.1 days in the monorepo versus 6.5 days
in the polyrepo — a 52% reduction that compounds across the projected hiring
plan (110 new engineers over 3 years).
PROBLEM STATEMENT
The PreOne codebase is split across five Git repositories with no enforced
cross-references, producing coordination overhead (4-5 days per cross-cutting
feature), drift between backend/frontend/docs, and slow onboarding. We need
a single repository structure that makes cross-cutting changes atomic, mirrors
the logical architecture on the filesystem, and supports the modular monolith
(ADR-002), Clean Architecture (ADR-003), and DDD (ADR-004) without
ceremony.
CONSTRAINTS
● Monorepo must remain navigable — no engineer should need >30
seconds to locate any class, file, or document
● Backend must use Gradle multi-project build with one subproject per
bounded context (12 subprojects total)
● Directory structure must mirror ADR-010 package naming so that the
file path predicts the Java package
● Shared kernel (/preone/backend/shared) must be a separate Gradle
subproject that all modules depend on, never a 'commons' dumping
ground
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 189

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
● Frontend structure must mirror backend modules so that a module's
backend and frontend code are co-located conceptually
● Infra (Terraform) must be co-located with the application so that
schema migrations (Flyway) and infra changes (Terraform) are
reviewable in one PR
● Adding a new module must be a single command (scaffold script), not a
multi-file manual process
● ArchUnit rules (ADR-007) must be auto-registered when a new module
is scaffolded — no manual rule editing
ASSUMPTIONS
● The set of top-level directories (backend, frontend, infra, docs, scripts)
is stable; new top-level dirs are rare and trigger ADR amendment
● Gradle multi-project build scales to 12 subprojects without
unacceptable configuration time (target: <30s for clean build)
● The 12 bounded contexts (identity, academic, student, guardian,
teacher, enrollment, billing, attendance, reporting, notification,
communication, audit) are stable; new contexts are added via the
scaffold script, not via structural changes
● Git can handle a monorepo of the projected size (~500k LOC at 5-year
horizon) without LFS for source files (LFS used only for binary assets in
/docs/images)
● Engineers will use the scaffold script rather than hand-creating module
directories (CI verifies new modules were scaffolded, not hand-rolled)
● Frontend module mirroring does not require that every backend
module have a frontend module — some backend modules (audit,
notification) are backend-only

DECISION
ADOPTED
We adopt a monorepo at /preone with five top-level directories: (1)
/preone/backend — Java 21 / Spring Boot 3, Gradle multi-project build with
one subproject per bounded context (identity, academic, student, guardian,
teacher, enrollment, billing, attendance, reporting, notification,
communication, audit) plus a shared kernel subproject (shared); each
subproject follows the /preone/backend/<module>/<layer>/<aggregate>
hierarchy from ADR-010 (e.g.,
/preone/backend/enrollment/domain/enrollment/EnrollmentAggregate.java
). (2) /preone/frontend — React 18 / TypeScript 5 with
/preone/frontend/src/<module>/<component-type> structure mirroring
backend modules (e.g.,
/preone/frontend/src/enrollment/components/EnrollmentForm.tsx). (3)
/preone/infra — Terraform modules per environment (dev, test, staging,
prod) plus shared modules (network, database, cache, S3). (4) /preone/docs
— Markdown documentation including ADRs, runbooks, onboarding guides,
and architecture diagrams. (5) /preone/scripts — Build, deploy, and
operational scripts (scaffold-module.sh, deploy.sh, db-snapshot.sh). New
modules are added via /preone/scripts/scaffold-module.sh <module-name>,
which generates the layer skeleton, registers the Gradle subproject in
settings.gradle, declares module-info.java, and adds ArchUnit rules to the
architecture test suite — all in one command. The shared kernel
(/preone/backend/shared) contains only cross-cutting value objects (Money,
EmailAddress, TenantId), exception base classes, and utility interfaces —
never business logic.

DETAILED RATIONALE
The monorepo was chosen because the coordination cost it eliminates is
structural and cannot be solved by polyrepo automation. The pre-v1.0 polyrepo
model had自动化 for cross-repo PRs (a custom script that opened PRs in 5 repos
from one template), but the automation did not solve the real problem: the five
PRs were reviewed by different people, merged at different times, and deployed
at different times, producing a window where the backend called an API that
the frontend no longer rendered or the Terraform provisioned a table that the
Flyway migration had not yet created. The monorepo eliminates the window by
making the change atomic — one PR, one review, one merge, one deploy. The
five-directory top-level structure is the minimum that covers the system without
redundancy. /backend and /frontend are split because they are different
languages (Java vs TypeScript) with different toolchains (Gradle vs npm) and
different CI concerns; merging them into /src would force every engineer to
clone both toolchains even if they only worked on one. /infra is separate from
/backend because Terraform and Java have different lifecycles (Terraform
applies are gated by ARB approval, Java deploys are gated by CI) and different
review audiences (infra changes reviewed by DevOps, backend changes
reviewed by Domain Architects). /docs and /scripts are separate because they
are consumed differently — /docs is read by all engineers and is the entry point
for onboarding, while /scripts is invoked by CI and on-call engineers. Adding a
sixth top-level directory (e.g., /mobile if a React Native app is added) requires
an ADR amendment because the five-directory contract is part of the
navigability guarantee. The backend structure mirrors ADR-010's package
naming exactly so that the file path predicts the Java package. A class at
/preone/backend/enrollment/domain/enrollment/EnrollmentAggregate.java is
in package com.preone.enrollment.domain.enrollment — the path and the
package are isomorphic. This eliminates the cognitive tax of mapping between
filesystem and package, which in the pre-v1.0 codebase required an IDE 'find
class' operation for every navigation. The isomorphism is enforced by a Gradle
plugin (preone-conventions) that fails the build if a file's path does not match its
declared package. The /<layer>/<aggregate> subdivision within each module
(e.g., /enrollment/domain/enrollment/, /enrollment/domain/enrollmentline/,
/enrollment/application/, /enrollment/infrastructure/, /enrollment/api/) makes
the aggregate boundaries (ADR-022) visible on the filesystem — an engineer
can see at a glance that the Enrollment context has two aggregates (Enrollment
and EnrollmentLine) because there are two subdirectories under /domain/.
The shared kernel (/preone/backend/shared) is the most contested decision in
this ADR. The temptation is to make /shared a dumping ground for 'common'
code that does not fit anywhere else — a temptation that produced a 4,000-line
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 193

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
Commons.java in the pre-v1.0 codebase, containing everything from date
utilities to HTTP client wrappers to business-rule constants. The v3.0 contract
is strict: /shared contains only (a) cross-cutting value objects used by 3+
modules (Money, EmailAddress, TenantId, AuditTimestamp), (b) exception
base classes (DomainException, InfrastructureException, ApiException), and
(c) utility interfaces (Clock, IdGenerator, TransactionManager) that have no
implementation in /shared (implementations live in /backend/bootstrap).
Business logic, domain events, and module-specific types are forbidden in
/shared — ArchUnit enforces this by failing the build if /shared imports any
module's package. The shared kernel is a leaf dependency — it depends on
nothing and everything depends on it — which keeps it small and stable. The
Gradle multi-project build with one subproject per module is the enforcement
mechanism for ADR-002's module boundaries. Each subproject has its own
build.gradle that declares its dependencies on other subprojects (e.g.,
enrollment depends on shared, identity, student; enrollment does NOT depend
on billing — billing is reached via the in-process event bus, ADR-027). The
build.gradle dependency declarations are themselves ArchUnit-verifiable: a
module that declares a dependency on a forbidden module fails the build. This
means the dependency graph is declared in three places — build.gradle (build
time), module-info.java (compile time), and ArchUnit rules (test time) — and all
three must agree. The triple declaration is intentional: each layer catches
violations the others might miss (build.gradle catches new dependencies at PR
time, module-info catches them at compile time, ArchUnit catches them at test
time even if the other two were bypassed). The frontend structure mirrors
backend modules so that an engineer working on the Enrollment feature can
find both the backend (at /backend/enrollment/) and the frontend (at
/frontend/src/enrollment/) by navigating the same module name. The
/<component-type> subdivision (components, hooks, services, types, pages)
follows React conventions and is enforced by an ESLint rule that fails the build
if a component file is placed in /hooks or vice versa. Not every backend module
has a frontend counterpart: audit and notification are backend-only (consumed
via dashboards built on the reporting module's frontend). The frontend
structure does not mirror the backend's four-layer Clean Architecture — React
components do not have a 'domain layer' in the Java sense — but the module
boundaries match, which is the property that matters for cross-cutting
changes. The scaffold script (/preone/scripts/scaffold-module.sh) is the most
operationally important decision in this ADR. In the pre-v1.0 codebase, adding
a new module was a 2-3 day manual process: create the directory structure,
write the build.gradle, register in settings.gradle, create the module-info.java,
add ArchUnit rules, create the base classes, and update the documentation.
Engineers routinely skipped steps (especially ArchUnit registration), producing
modules that existed on the filesystem but were not enforced by the
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 194

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
architecture tests. The scaffold script generates all of this in one command and
is the only supported way to add a module — CI verifies that any PR adding a
module also includes the scaffold script's output, and manual module creation
is rejected at code review. The script also generates a stub ADR-0xx for the new
module, prompting the engineer to document the module's purpose before
writing code.

DATABASE IMPACT
The directory structure does not directly affect the database schema, but it
enforces the schema-per-module convention from ADR-041 indirectly. Each
backend module owns its Flyway migration files at
/preone/backend/<module>/src/main/resources/db/migration/, with file
naming V<date>__<module>__<change>.sql (e.g.,
V20260115__enrollment__add_withdrawal_reason.sql). Cross-module foreign
keys are forbidden (ADR-041); a module that references another module's
aggregate does so by UUID, not by FK. The shared kernel has no database
impact — it contains no entities, no JPA mappings, and no migrations. The
/preone/infra directory contains Terraform that provisions the PostgreSQL
instance, Redis instance, and S3 bucket per environment (ADR-015); schema
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 196

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
migrations within those instances are owned by /backend, not by /infra,
separating provisioning (infra) from schema (backend).
API IMPACT
The directory structure mirrors the API surface: each backend module's /api/
directory contains its REST controllers, and the OpenAPI spec for each module
lives at /preone/docs/api/<module>-openapi.yaml. The frontend's per-module
service layer (at /preone/frontend/src/<module>/services/) imports TypeScript
types generated from the OpenAPI spec, so a change to the backend API spec
triggers a frontend type regeneration in the same PR. This isomorphic mapping
— backend module -> API spec -> frontend service — means an engineer
searching for the implementation of any API endpoint can navigate by module
name across all three locations. The OpenAPI spec is the single source of truth
for the API contract (ADR-091); the controllers and the frontend services are
both generated/verified against it.
UI IMPACT
The frontend structure at /preone/frontend/src/<module>/<component-type>
mirrors the backend module list so that an engineer working on 'Enrollment'
finds the React code at /src/enrollment/ and the Java code at
/backend/enrollment/. The /<component-type> subdirectories (components,
hooks, services, types, pages, utils) follow React conventions and are enforced
by ESLint. Cross-module frontend code (e.g., a shared EnrollmentPicker used
by Billing and Attendance) lives in /preone/frontend/src/shared/components/,
mirroring the backend shared kernel. The frontend does not mirror the
backend's four-layer Clean Architecture because React's component model
does not map to domain/application/infrastructure layers — the module
boundary is the relevant isomorphism, not the layer boundary.
SECURITY IMPACT
The directory structure improves security posture by making sensitive code
locations predictable and auditable. All code that handles secrets (AWS Secrets
Manager integration, JWT signing keys) lives in /preone/backend/bootstrap/ —
a single subproject that no other module imports directly; secrets are injected
via Spring's Environment abstraction and never appear in module code.
ArchUnit rules forbid any module other than bootstrap from importing
cryptography libraries (java.security, javax.crypto) directly, centralising crypto
in audited locations. The /preone/scripts/ directory is reviewed by DevOps for
any script that handles credentials; scripts that read secrets are marked
executable only by CI, not by individual engineers. The /preone/infra/ directory
contains no secrets — Terraform variables reference AWS Secrets Manager
ARNs, never the secret values themselves.
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 197

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
The directory structure has no runtime performance impact — it is a build-time
and developer-experience concern. The Gradle multi-project build adds 8-12
seconds of configuration time versus a single-project build (target: <30s for
clean build, currently 24s on CI). This is offset by incremental build support: a
change to one module rebuilds only that module and its dependents, not the
entire codebase. The shared kernel is small (~30 classes) so its compilation
cost is negligible. The frontend monorepo with npm workspaces has similar
properties: a change to one module's package rebuilds only that package and
its dependents. Overall, the build-time cost of the monorepo structure is <5% of
total build time and is reclaimed many times over by the cycle-time reduction.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
The monorepo scales with the engineering organisation. At 40 engineers
(current), the structure is navigable — 'git status' runs in <1s, 'find . -name
*.java' runs in <2s. At 150 engineers (3-year target), the repo will be ~500k
LOC; Git operations will be 2-3x slower but still acceptable (~3s for 'git status').
At 500+ engineers, sparse-checkout (Git's partial-clone feature) will allow
engineers to work on a subset of the repo without cloning the full tree. The
Gradle multi-project build scales to 20-25 subprojects before configuration time
becomes problematic; the current 12+1 (modules + shared) leaves headroom
for 8-12 new modules before a structural change (e.g., grouping subprojects
into /backend/<group>/) is needed. The scaffold script ensures that new
modules are added uniformly, preventing the structural drift that would
otherwise accumulate.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Operations benefit from the monorepo because the /preone/scripts/ directory is
the single source of operational truth. The deploy script (deploy.sh) reads the
version from /backend/build.gradle, builds the container image, pushes to ECR,
and triggers the blue-green deploy (ADR-018) — all from one location. The db-
snapshot.sh script reads the environment configuration from
/infra/environments/<env>/terraform.tfvars and connects to the correct
PostgreSQL instance (ADR-015) — there is no per-environment script
duplication. On-call engineers clone the repo once and have all scripts
available; there is no 'which repo has the runbook?' problem. The
/preone/docs/runbooks/ directory is the authoritative source for incident
runbooks, and the monorepo ensures that a runbook change can be reviewed
alongside the code change that prompted it.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
Polyrepo with automation was rejected because the coordination cost is
structural, not tooling-related: the five PRs in five repos were reviewed and
merged at different times, producing drift windows that automation could not
close. The hybrid (backend+frontend monorepo, infra+docs separate) was
rejected because the most failure-prone coordination was between backend
schema migrations (Flyway) and infra table provisioning (Terraform) — exactly
the split that the hybrid preserves. The single-flat-repo option was rejected
because it cannot enforce module boundaries at build time (ADR-002 requires
build-time enforcement via Gradle subprojects), and ArchUnit alone is
insufficient because it runs at test time, not at compile time — a module
boundary violation would only be caught after the build succeeds, not during
compilation. The Nx/Bazel monorepo tooling was considered and rejected in
favour of plain Gradle multi-project because the team's Gradle expertise (Java)
is stronger than Bazel expertise, and Gradle's multi-project support is sufficient

for 12-25 subprojects; Bazel's incremental build advantages only materialise at
>100 subprojects, which PreOne will not reach in the 5-year horizon.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q4 2025) consolidated the five pre-v1.0 repositories into
the monorepo using git-filter-repo to preserve history. The migration was
executed over a single weekend: (1) import /backend from the pre-v1.0 backend
repo, restructured into 12 module subprojects + shared; (2) import /frontend
from the pre-v1.0 frontend repo, restructured into per-module src/ directories;
(3) import /infra from the pre-v1.0 Terraform repo, restructured into modules/
and environments/; (4) import /docs from the pre-v1.0 docs repo; (5) import
/scripts from the pre-v1.0 scripts repo. The old repositories were archived
(read-only) and a redirect README was added pointing to the monorepo. The
v3.0 refresh adds the scaffold script (which did not exist in v1.0 — modules
were created manually until Q1 2026) and the shared-kernel contract (which
was informal in v1.0 — ArchUnit enforcement of /shared's leaf-dependency
status was added in v3.0). No code migration is required for v3.0 — the contract
is enforced going forward.
TESTING STRATEGY
The directory structure is tested at three levels. (1) Build-time: Gradle's multi-
project configuration fails if a subproject's directory does not match its
declared name (e.g., a subproject named 'enrollment' must live at
/backend/enrollment/). (2) Compile-time: the preone-conventions Gradle plugin
fails the build if a file's path does not match its declared package (path-package
isomorphism). (3) Test-time: ArchUnit rules verify that the shared kernel does
not import any module package, that each module's module-info.java exports
only its /api/ package, and that no module imports another module's /domain/ or
/infrastructure/ packages. Additionally, the scaffold script has a unit test
(scaffold-module.test.sh) that verifies the script produces the expected file set
for a sample module name; this test runs in CI to catch regressions in the
scaffold script itself.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
The directory structure is monitored via repository-health metrics published
quarterly: (a) repo size in MB and file count (target: <500MB, <50k files at
current scale; <1GB, <100k files at 5-year horizon); (b) Gradle configuration
time (target: <30s); (c) percentage of modules created via scaffold script vs
manual (target: 100% via scaffold); (d) shared-kernel size in classes (target:
<50 classes; alert if >75); (e) cross-module dependency count per module
(target: <5 dependencies per module; alert if >8, indicating a module is
becoming a hub). Anomalies trigger an architecture review at the next ARB.

The metrics are computed by a weekly CI job that runs `cloc`, `git log`, and a
custom Gradle task that emits the dependency graph as JSON.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The five-directory top-level structure is stable; the most likely evolution is the
addition of a /mobile directory if PreOne adds a React Native parent app
(currently under product evaluation). A /mobile directory would be added via an
ADR amendment that defines its internal structure (mirroring /frontend's
module-based layout) and its relationship to /backend (separate consumer of
the same API). The 12-module backend list is expected to grow to 14-16
modules over 3 years (candidate modules: transport for bus tracking, health for
medical records, inventory for school supplies) — each added via the scaffold
script without structural change. If the module count exceeds 20, a grouping
level (/backend/<group>/<module>/) may be introduced to preserve
navigability, but this is not anticipated in the 5-year horizon. The shared kernel
is expected to remain small (~30-50 classes) and stable; growth beyond 50
classes is a signal that the kernel is becoming a commons and triggers an ARB
review.

DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Adopt a five-level configuration hierarchy for the PreOne platform: (1)
defaults.yml packaged in the JAR provides sensible defaults; (2)
application.yml per Spring profile (dev, test, staging, prod) overrides
defaults; (3) environment variables override yml for environment-specific
values; (4) AWS Secrets Manager provides production secrets fetched at
startup; (5) command-line args provide the highest-priority overrides.
Configuration is validated at startup — the application fails fast on missing
required config or invalid values. Secrets never appear in Git or in yml files;
they live exclusively in AWS Secrets Manager (prod) or environment
variables (non-prod). Production configuration changes require an ADR;
non-prod changes require a PR review.

(e.g., AWS AppConfig for dynamic
config)
Supersedes None (v1.0 original; v3.0 refresh
adds the startup validation contract
and the config-as-ADR governance
rule)
CONTEXT
Before v1.0, PreOne's configuration was ad-hoc: each Spring Boot service had
its own application.yml checked into Git, with environment-specific values
hardcoded for dev and commented-out blocks for staging and prod. Secrets
(database passwords, JWT signing keys, third-party API keys for Razorpay,
Twilio, AWS SES) were stored in a .env file that was supposed to be Git-ignored
but was accidentally committed three times in the first six months of operation,
each time requiring a credential rotation across all affected services. The team
estimated that 30% of production incidents in the first year were caused by
configuration errors: a missing environment variable, a typo in a YAML key, a
default value that was wrong for production, a secret that expired without
anyone noticing. The v1.0 architecture reset made configuration a first-class
concern. The team evaluated Spring Boot's native configuration mechanisms
(profiles, property sources, @ConfigurationProperties) and decided that
Spring's mechanisms were sufficient but required a strict governance layer on
top: a defined precedence order, a startup validation contract, and a secret-
management discipline that mechanically prevented secrets from entering Git.
The five-level hierarchy was designed to make the precedence order explicit
and predictable — an engineer debugging a misconfiguration should be able to
enumerate the five levels in order and identify which one is providing the
current value, without guessing. The v3.0 refresh adds two refinements that
were informal in v1.0. First, the startup validation contract: every
@ConfigurationProperties class declares required fields and validation
constraints (@NotNull, @Min, @Pattern), and the application fails to start if
any required config is missing or invalid — silent defaults for required fields are
forbidden. Second, the config-as-ADR governance rule: any change to
production configuration (application-prod.yml, secrets in Secrets Manager,
environment variables in the prod deployment) requires an ADR that justifies
the change; non-prod configuration changes require a PR review but not an

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADR. This rule prevents configuration drift — the silent accumulation of small
changes that, over time, make the production configuration incomprehensible
to anyone who did not make each change.
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary business driver is incident reduction: 30% of pre-v1.0 production
incidents were configuration-related. A strict configuration hierarchy with
startup validation eliminates the entire class of 'missing config' and 'invalid
config' incidents — the application fails to start rather than starting in a broken
state. The estimated incident-reduction value is 12-15 fewer production
incidents per year, each avoided incident saving 4-8 engineer-hours of incident
response. The secondary driver is secret hygiene: the three accidental secret
commits in pre-v1.0 each required 40-60 engineer-hours of rotation work
(regenerate secret, update all consumers, verify no stale references, audit
access logs for the exposure window). The AWS Secrets Manager integration
makes secret commits structurally impossible — secrets never appear in any
file that could be committed, because they are fetched at startup from a source
that has no Git representation. The tertiary driver is onboarding: a new
engineer can understand the production configuration by reading defaults.yml
(sensible defaults) and application-prod.yml (overrides) — there is no hidden
state, no 'you also need to know about' surprises. The five-level hierarchy is
documented in this ADR and is the single source of truth for how configuration
works.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
PreOne's configuration is ad-hoc, with environment-specific values hardcoded
in yml files, secrets accidentally committed to Git, and 30% of production
incidents caused by configuration errors. We need a strict configuration
hierarchy with explicit precedence, startup validation, secret management that
prevents Git exposure, and governance that prevents configuration drift.
CONSTRAINTS
● Configuration precedence must be deterministic and enumerable — an
engineer must be able to predict which source provides a given value
● Startup validation must fail fast — missing required config or invalid
values must prevent the application from starting, not produce a
running-but-broken service
● Secrets (passwords, API keys, JWT signing keys) must never appear in
Git, never appear in yml files, and never appear in application logs
● Production configuration changes require an ADR; non-prod changes
require a PR review — no anonymous configuration edits
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 206

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
● The hierarchy must work identically across all four environments (dev,
test, staging, prod) — only the values differ, not the structure
● Spring Boot's native @ConfigurationProperties and profile mechanism
must be used — no custom configuration framework
● AWS Secrets Manager integration must fetch secrets at startup, cache
them in memory, and refresh them periodically (no per-request secret
fetch)
ASSUMPTIONS
● Spring Boot 3's property source precedence (command-line > env vars
> application-{profile}.yml > application.yml) is sufficient and will not
be overridden
● AWS Secrets Manager's API is reliable enough for startup fetches
(mitigated by retry with exponential backoff)
● The set of configuration sources (5 levels) is stable; new sources (e.g.,
AWS AppConfig for dynamic config) require an ADR amendment
● Engineers will use @ConfigurationProperties classes (not @Value
annotations) for all configuration — @Value is forbidden by ArchUnit
● Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager are rotated on a defined schedule (90
days for API keys, 365 days for database passwords); rotation is
automated where the secret consumer supports it
● The four Spring profiles (dev, test, staging, prod) are stable; new
profiles require an ADR amendment

DECISION
ADOPTED
We adopt a five-level configuration hierarchy with strict precedence and
startup validation. The levels, in increasing precedence (later levels
override earlier), are: (1) defaults.yml packaged in the JAR at
/src/main/resources/defaults.yml — provides sensible defaults for all non-
secret configuration (e.g., server.port=8080,
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=20); this file is version-
controlled and reviewed. (2) application-{profile}.yml per Spring profile
(application-dev.yml, application-test.yml, application-staging.yml,
application-prod.yml) at /src/main/resources/ — overrides defaults for
environment-specific non-secret values (e.g., database host, Redis host, log
level); these files are version-controlled and reviewed. (3) Environment
variables (SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL, SPRING_REDIS_HOST, etc.)
override yml for environment-specific values that vary by deployment (e.g.,
the database URL within a profile, where staging has multiple databases);
environment variables are set by Terraform (ADR-015) and are never
checked into Git. (4) AWS Secrets Manager provides production secrets
(database password, JWT signing key, third-party API keys for
Razorpay/Twilio/SES) fetched at startup via a Spring Boot config client;
secrets are referenced in yml by ARN (e.g.,
${secretsmanager:prod/preone/db-password}) and never appear in any
file. (5) Command-line arguments (--server.port=9090) provide the highest-
priority overrides for one-off operational needs (e.g., running a temporary
instance on a different port); these are rarely used in production. Startup
validation: every @ConfigurationProperties class declares required fields
with JSR-303 constraints (@NotNull, @Min, @Max, @Pattern); the
application fails to start if any required field is missing or invalid.
Governance: production configuration changes (application-prod.yml,
Secrets Manager entries, prod environment variables) require an ADR; non-
prod changes require a PR review.
DETAILED RATIONALE
The five-level hierarchy was chosen because it makes configuration precedence
explicit and predictable while reusing Spring Boot's native mechanisms. Spring
Boot already supports property source precedence (command-line > env vars >
application-{profile}.yml > application.yml), so the five-level hierarchy is a
documentation and discipline layer on top of Spring, not a replacement. The
choice to use Spring's native mechanisms rather than an externalised config
server (Spring Cloud Config, option 2) reflects the modular monolith decision
(ADR-002): a single deployable does not need a separate config server, and
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 209

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
adding one introduces a critical infrastructure dependency (the config server
must be up for any application instance to start). For a distributed system with
20+ services, a config server pays for itself; for a monolith with N replicas, it is
pure overhead. The defaults.yml file (level 1) is the most important innovation
in this hierarchy. In pre-v1.0, every deployment had to specify every
configuration value, because there were no defaults — a missing
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL caused the app to fail with an obscure 'no
database configured' error, and the engineer had to know that this env var was
required. defaults.yml encodes the 'sensible default' for every configuration
key: server.port=8080, spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=20,
spring.jpa.open-in-view=false, preone.audit.enabled=true. These defaults are
correct for 90% of deployments; the 10% that need different values override via
levels 2-5. The benefit is that a developer running the app locally with no
configuration at all gets a working instance (using all defaults), rather than a
cryptic startup failure. The cost is that defaults.yml must be curated — a bad
default (e.g., defaults.yml setting preone.security.auth-required=false) is a
security hole that propagates to every deployment that does not override it.
This is mitigated by code review of defaults.yml (any change requires Chief
Architect approval) and by ArchUnit tests that verify certain security-critical
defaults are not false. The per-profile yml files (level 2) encode environment-
specific overrides that are not secret. For example, application-staging.yml sets
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://staging-db.preone.internal:5432/
preone (the staging database host), spring.jpa.show-sql=false, preone.feature-
flags.environment=staging. These files are version-controlled and reviewed, so
an engineer can see the entire staging configuration by reading one file. The
staging and prod yml files are nearly identical (both production-like), with
differences only in hosts and feature flag values. The dev and test yml files are
more divergent (dev uses Testcontainers for the database, test uses an in-
memory H2 for fast unit tests). Environment variables (level 3) are used for
values that vary within a profile — e.g., staging has multiple database instances
(one per region), and the env var SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL selects which
one. Environment variables are also used for secrets in non-prod environments
(dev, test), where AWS Secrets Manager is not justified. The rule is: in dev and
test, secrets come from env vars (set by docker-compose or CI); in staging and
prod, secrets come from AWS Secrets Manager. This split reflects the
operational cost of Secrets Manager (each secret fetch is an API call with a
small per-call cost) and the security benefit (Secrets Manager provides audit
logging and automatic rotation, which are not needed for dev/test secrets that
are synthetic anyway). AWS Secrets Manager (level 4) is the production secret
store. Secrets are referenced in yml by ARN using Spring Cloud AWS's secrets
manager integration:
spring.datasource.password=${secretsmanager:prod/preone/db-password}.
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 210

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
At startup, the application fetches the secret value from Secrets Manager and
injects it into the Spring Environment. Secrets are cached in memory for 5
minutes (configurable) and refreshed in the background, avoiding per-request
secret fetches. The benefits over env-var secrets are: (a) secrets never appear
in any file (no accidental Git commit risk); (b) secrets are rotated automatically
by Secrets Manager rotation lambdas (database passwords rotated every 365
days, API keys every 90 days); (c) every secret access is logged to CloudTrail,
providing an audit trail. The cost is a startup dependency: if Secrets Manager is
unavailable, the application cannot start. This is mitigated by retry with
exponential backoff (3 retries, 2s/4s/8s) and by the fact that Secrets Manager is
a regional AWS service with high availability. Command-line arguments (level
5) are the highest-precedence override, used rarely for one-off operational
needs. The most common use is --preone.feature-flags.force-off=<flag-name>
to disable a feature flag at startup (kill switch), or --server.port=9090 to run a
second instance on a different port for debugging. Command-line args are
never used for routine configuration — they are explicit, visible in the process
arguments (ps aux), and reviewed by DevOps before use in production. The
startup validation contract is the most important governance mechanism in this
ADR. Every @ConfigurationProperties class declares required fields with
JSR-303 constraints: @NotBlank String dbHost; @Min(1) @Max(100) int
poolSize; @Pattern(regexp = "^[a-z]{2}-[a-z]{3,8}-\\d$") String environment.
At startup, Spring validates these constraints and fails fast if any are violated.
This eliminates the 'running but broken' failure mode where the app starts with
a null database host and only fails when the first database query is attempted.
The validation is mechanical — it does not depend on engineer vigilance.
ArchUnit rules forbid @Value annotations (which bypass
@ConfigurationProperties validation), ensuring all configuration goes through
the validated path. The config-as-ADR governance rule (v3.0 addition)
addresses configuration drift. In v1.0, production configuration changes were
made via PR to application-prod.yml, which was reviewed but not governed —
over 18 months, the file accumulated 47 changes, each small and reasonable in
isolation, but collectively producing a configuration that no single engineer
could fully explain. The v3.0 rule requires an ADR for any production
configuration change that (a) adds or removes a configuration key, (b) changes
a value by more than 2x, or (c) changes a security-relevant setting (auth,
encryption, rate limits). The ADR documents the change, the reason, and the
rollback plan. Non-prod changes (dev, test, staging) still go via PR review
without an ADR, because the blast radius of a non-prod misconfiguration is
contained. This rule has reduced production config changes by 60% (engineers
now think harder before proposing a change, knowing it requires an ADR) and
has produced a documented history of every production config change that is
auditable by security and compliance teams.

DATABASE IMPACT
The configuration hierarchy directly controls database connectivity:
spring.datasource.url (level 2 or 3), spring.datasource.password (level 4 via
Secrets Manager), spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size (level 1
default, overrideable). The startup validation contract verifies that the
database is reachable at startup — a failed connection test fails the startup,
preventing the app from serving traffic with a broken database. HikariCP
connection pool settings (maximum-pool-size, minimum-idle, connection-
timeout) are configured via @ConfigurationProperties with validation:
maximum-pool-size must be between 5 and 100 (ArchUnit rule), preventing
both under-provisioning (too few connections for the workload) and over-
provisioning (too many connections exhausting PostgreSQL's
max_connections). Flyway migration settings (spring.flyway.enabled,
spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate) are configured per profile: enabled in
dev/test/staging/prod, disabled in test for fast unit tests (H2 in-memory does
not run Flyway).
API IMPACT
The configuration hierarchy controls API behaviour: server.port (level 1 default
8080, overrideable), server.servlet.context-path (/api by default),
preone.api.rate-limit.enabled (level 1 default true, overrideable per profile).
The startup validation verifies that the API port is not in use (a port-in-use fails
startup rather than producing a confusing bind error later). Feature flags
(ADR-016) are configured via the hierarchy: preone.feature-flags.environment
(level 2 or 3) selects which flag set to load; flags themselves are stored in
PostgreSQL and Redis (ADR-016), not in the configuration hierarchy. The
OpenAPI spec generation (springdoc.openapi.enabled) is configured per
profile: enabled in dev/staging for spec verification, disabled in prod (spec is
generated at build time, not at runtime).
UI IMPACT
The frontend has its own configuration hierarchy (mirroring the backend's five
levels): defaults in the React app's build-time config, per-environment overrides
in .env files (VITE_API_BASE_URL, VITE_SENTRY_DSN), runtime overrides via
window.__PREONE_CONFIG__ injected by the server. The frontend does not
have access to backend secrets (no AWS Secrets Manager integration) — the
frontend's configuration is limited to public values (API base URL, feature flag
endpoint, Sentry DSN). Secrets that the frontend needs (e.g., a Stripe
publishable key, which is not secret in the same way as a private key) are
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 214

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
injected via window.__PREONE_CONFIG__ at server-side render time, fetched
from Secrets Manager by the backend and passed to the frontend template —
never checked into the frontend's .env files.
SECURITY IMPACT
The configuration hierarchy is the primary defence against secret exposure.
The rule 'secrets never in Git, never in yml, always in Secrets Manager (prod) or
env vars (non-prod)' is enforced mechanically: (a) ArchUnit rules forbid any yml
file from containing keys that match a secret pattern (password, secret, key,
token) with a non-placeholder value; (b) a pre-commit hook scans yml files for
secret-like patterns and rejects the commit; (c) AWS Secrets Manager
integration means prod secrets have no Git representation at all — they exist
only in Secrets Manager and are fetched at runtime. The startup validation
contract improves security by failing fast on misconfigured security settings:
preone.security.auth-required must be true (ArchUnit rule),
preone.security.encryption.algorithm must be a non-deprecated cipher
(validated by @Pattern), preone.security.jwt.expiry-seconds must be between
300 and 86400 (validated by @Min/@Max). A misconfiguration that would
weaken security (e.g., auth-required=false) is caught at startup, not in
production after an incident.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
The configuration hierarchy has minimal runtime performance impact. The
AWS Secrets Manager fetch at startup adds 200-500ms to startup time (one API
call per secret, parallelised; with 8 secrets, the fetch is ~300ms total). This is
amortised over the application's lifetime (a typical instance runs for days or
weeks). The in-memory cache (5-minute TTL) means no per-request secret
fetch. The startup validation adds <100ms (JSR-303 validation is fast). The
overall startup time is 8-12 seconds (including Spring context, database
connection, Flyway migration, Secrets Manager fetch, validation), which is
acceptable for a blue-green deployment (ADR-018) with 30-second traffic
shifting. The configuration hierarchy does not affect steady-state request
latency — configuration is read at startup and cached in Spring's Environment,
not re-read per request.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
The configuration hierarchy scales with the number of application instances,
not with traffic. Each instance fetches its own secrets at startup; with 10
replicas, there are 10 startup-time secret fetches, which Secrets Manager
handles easily (its API is designed for high request rates). The 5-minute secret
cache means the steady-state secret fetch rate is 1 fetch per 5 minutes per
instance (10 replicas = 2 fetches/minute total), well within Secrets Manager's
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 215

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
free tier. The startup validation contract does not scale with traffic — it runs
once at startup. The configuration hierarchy does not constrain horizontal
scaling (ADR-126): adding more replicas does not require configuration
changes, because each replica reads the same configuration sources and
validates identically.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Operations benefit from the config-as-ADR governance rule: every production
configuration change is documented, justified, and rollbackable. The on-call
engineer investigating a production incident can review the recent ADRs to see
what configuration changed, rather than guessing from a diff of application-
prod.yml. The startup validation contract improves operability by producing
clear, actionable error messages at startup — 'required configuration
preone.database.host is missing' is a better error than 'NullPointerException in
DataSource initialization'. The AWS Secrets Manager integration requires
operational discipline: secrets must be rotated on schedule (automated by
Secrets Manager rotation lambdas, but the on-call engineer must verify
rotation succeeded), and the Secrets Manager IAM policy must be reviewed
quarterly to ensure only the application role can read the secrets. The 5-minute
secret cache means a rotated secret may take up to 5 minutes to take effect —
this is documented in the runbook for secret rotation incidents.

TRADE-OFFS
We Gain We Lose
Deterministic, enumerable Engineers must learn the hierarchy
configuration precedence (5 levels) (onboarding cost)
Startup validation eliminates 'running Startup takes 8-12s (including
but broken' config errors validation and secret fetch)
Secrets never in Git (mechanically AWS Secrets Manager adds a startup
prevented) dependency and a small per-secret cost
Config-as-ADR governance prevents Prod config changes require an ADR
configuration drift (slower than a direct PR)
REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
Spring Cloud Config Server was rejected because it adds a critical
infrastructure dependency (the Config Server must be up for any application
instance to start) that is not justified for a single-deployable modular monolith
(ADR-002). For a distributed system with 20+ services, a Config Server pays for
itself in centralised management; for a monolith with N replicas, the same
configuration is already centralised in the JAR and the per-profile yml files.
HashiCorp Vault was rejected for the same reason (operationally heavy for the
2-engineer DevOps team) and because Vault's strengths (dynamic secrets,
lease management) are overkill for PreOne's needs — PreOne has ~20 secrets,
not thousands. The environment-variables-only option (12-factor app) was
rejected because it loses Spring's @ConfigurationProperties type safety and
validation, and because env vars are flat (no nested config) — the team
evaluated it and found that the configuration became a 200-line list of env vars
with no structure, no defaults, and no validation. The five-level hierarchy reuses
Spring's strengths (profiles, @ConfigurationProperties, JSR-303 validation)
while adding the governance layer (config-as-ADR, secret hygiene) that Spring
does not provide natively.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q4 2025) extracted all configuration from the pre-v1.0 ad-
hoc state into the five-level hierarchy. The migration was executed in three
phases over 6 weeks: (1) Phase 1 — extract defaults: every configuration key
with a sensible default was moved to defaults.yml; keys without sensible
defaults (e.g., database URL) were left for level 2/3. (2) Phase 2 — extract
secrets: every secret in the pre-v1.0 .env files was moved to AWS Secrets
Manager (prod) or environment variables (dev/test/staging); the .env files were
deleted and added to .gitignore. (3) Phase 3 — add validation: every
configuration class was annotated with @ConfigurationProperties and JSR-303
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 218

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
constraints; the application was tested to fail fast on missing required config.
The v3.0 refresh adds the config-as-ADR governance rule (which was informal
in v1.0 — production config changes were reviewed but not ADR-governed) and
the ArchUnit rule forbidding @Value annotations (which was a code-review
convention in v1.0, not mechanically enforced).
TESTING STRATEGY
Configuration is tested at three levels. (1) Unit tests: every
@ConfigurationProperties class has a test that verifies it binds correctly from a
test property source and that JSR-303 validation catches invalid values (e.g.,
@Min(1) on poolSize rejects 0). (2) Integration tests: every Spring profile (dev,
test, staging, prod) has an integration test that boots the application with that
profile's yml and verifies the application starts successfully (startup validation
passes) and key beans are configured correctly (DataSource connects, Redis
client initialises). (3) Contract tests: the AWS Secrets Manager integration is
tested with a mock Secrets Manager (LocalStack) that verifies the application
fetches secrets correctly and fails fast on missing secrets. Additionally, a CI job
scans all yml files for secret-like patterns and fails the build if any are found —
this catches accidental secret commits before they reach the main branch.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Configuration is monitored via startup metrics and runtime metrics. Startup
metrics: time-to-start (target: <15s), secret-fetch-duration (target: <500ms),
validation-duration (target: <100ms). Anomalies in startup metrics trigger
alerts (e.g., startup >30s indicates a Secrets Manager slowdown or a validation
issue). Runtime metrics: configuration-change-count (number of beans
reconfigured at runtime — should be 0; any non-zero value indicates an
unexpected runtime config change, which is forbidden). The AWS Secrets
Manager integration emits CloudWatch metrics on every secret fetch (success
rate, latency), which are dash boarded alongside the application metrics. The
config-as-ADR governance rule is monitored by a quarterly report listing all
production configuration changes and their associated ADRs — any change
without an ADR is flagged for ARB review.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The five-level hierarchy is stable; the most likely evolution is the addition of
AWS AppConfig (level 6: dynamic configuration) for runtime-configurable
values that do not require a restart (e.g., feature flag overrides, rate limit
thresholds). AppConfig would be the highest-precedence level, overriding
command-line args, but only for non-secret dynamic values. This is a future
ADR (candidate ADR-017 or ADR-019) and is not part of the current hierarchy.
Another possible evolution is the addition of a level 0 (enterprise policy) for
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 219

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
configuration that is mandated by the security team and cannot be overridden
by any other level (e.g., encryption-algorithm must be AES-256-GCM,
regardless of what defaults.yml says). This would be enforced by a startup
policy check that overrides any conflicting configuration. Both evolutions are
additive (new levels) rather than structural (changing existing levels),
preserving the v3.0 contract.

DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Adopt four environments — dev (local laptop), test (CI/CD ephemeral),
staging (pre-prod, prod-like data subset), prod (live) — with strict data
isolation: each environment has its own PostgreSQL instance, Redis
instance, and S3 bucket, with no shared infrastructure. Test data is
synthetic (no real PII in non-prod environments); staging data is a sanitised
copy of prod (PII redacted, names anonymised, financial figures fuzzed)
refreshed weekly. Environments are provisioned via Terraform (ADR-130)
with naming convention preone-dev, preone-test, preone-staging, preone-
prod. Access: dev is open to all engineers; test is CI-only (no human access);
staging is restricted to the engineering team; prod is restricted to on-call
engineers and requires ARB approval for any change.

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
CONTEXT
Before v1.0, PreOne had two environments: 'dev' (a shared staging server that
everyone used for both development and pre-prod testing) and 'prod' (the live
system). There was no CI/CD environment — automated tests ran against the
dev server, often conflicting with manual testing by engineers. There was no
true staging environment — code went from dev to prod without a production-
like verification step. The dev server had a copy of production data (refreshed
quarterly by a manual DBA script) that included real parent names, real student
names, and real payment information — a compliance violation under the DPDP
Act 2023 that the security team flagged in Q2 2025 as a P0 risk. The v1.0
architecture reset established a four-environment model that separates
concerns: dev for individual engineer experimentation, test for automated
CI/CD verification, staging for pre-prod integration and performance testing
with production-like data, and prod for live traffic. The key innovation is the
data isolation contract: each environment has its own PostgreSQL, Redis, and
S3, with no shared infrastructure, no shared credentials, and no data flow from
prod to non-prod except via the sanitised-copy pipeline. This contract
eliminates the entire class of 'accidentally ran the script against prod' incidents
and the compliance risk of real PII in non-prod environments. The v3.0 refresh
adds two refinements. First, the sanitised-copy refresh contract: staging data is
refreshed weekly from prod via an automated pipeline that copies the prod
database, redacts PII (parent names -> 'Parent-<id>', student names ->
'Student-<id>', email addresses -> 'student-<id>@example.test'), fuzzes
financial figures (payment amounts randomly adjusted +/- 10%), and loads the
result into the staging database. The refresh is automated, auditable, and
produces a sanitised dataset that is statistically similar to prod (same row
counts, same distributions) without exposing any real personal data. Second,
the access-tier model: dev is open (any engineer can self-provision), test is CI-
only (no human login), staging is engineering-team-restricted (login requires
SSO + MFA), prod is on-call-restricted (login requires SSO + MFA + ARB-
approved change ticket). The tiers reflect the blast radius of each environment
— a mistake in dev affects one engineer; a mistake in prod affects all customers.
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary business driver is compliance: the DPDP Act 2023 (India's data
protection law) prohibits real PII from being used in non-production
environments without explicit consent, which PreOne does not have from
parents. The pre-v1.0 practice of using prod data in dev was a P0 compliance
violation that exposed PreOne to fines of up to 250 crore INR (approximately 30
million USD). The four-environment model with sanitised staging data
eliminates this risk entirely — non-prod environments contain no real PII, by
construction. The secondary driver is release confidence: a staging

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
environment with production-like data and production-like infrastructure
(separate PostgreSQL, Redis, S3) catches integration bugs and performance
regressions that a dev environment with synthetic data cannot. The pre-v1.0
'dev-as-staging' model missed 3-4 production incidents per quarter that would
have been caught by a true staging environment; the v1.0 four-environment
model reduced this to 0-1 incidents per quarter in the first year of operation.
The tertiary driver is engineering velocity: a CI/CD test environment that is
ephemeral (spun up per pipeline run, torn down after) eliminates the 'test
environment contention' problem where multiple engineers' test runs
conflicted on the shared dev server.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
PreOne has two environments (dev-as-staging and prod) with no CI/CD
isolation, no true pre-prod verification, and real PII in non-prod — a compliance
violation and a release-quality risk. We need a four-environment model (dev,
test, staging, prod) with strict data isolation, sanitised staging data, and tiered
access controls that match the blast radius of each environment.
CONSTRAINTS
● Each environment must have its own PostgreSQL instance, Redis
instance, and S3 bucket — no shared infrastructure
● No real PII may exist in non-prod environments (dev, test, staging) —
compliance with DPDP Act 2023
● Staging data must be a sanitised copy of prod, refreshed on a defined
schedule (weekly), with statistical similarity to prod (same row counts,
same distributions)
● Environments must be provisioned via Terraform (ADR-130) — no
manual infrastructure changes
● Environment naming must follow the preone-<env> convention
(preone-dev, preone-test, preone-staging, preone-prod) across all AWS
resources
● Access to prod must require SSO + MFA + ARB-approved change
ticket (no direct login for routine work)
● The test environment must be ephemeral (created per CI run,
destroyed after) — no persistent state
● Staging must be production-like in infrastructure (same instance types,
same Redis cluster mode, same S3 bucket configuration) but smaller in
scale (fewer replicas, smaller database instance)
ASSUMPTIONS
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 224

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
● AWS account structure supports four isolated environments (either four
sub-accounts under an organisation, or four isolated VPCs in one
account — ADR-130 decides)
● The sanitised-copy pipeline can refresh staging data weekly within a 4-
hour maintenance window (Saturday 02:00-06:00 IST)
● Engineers will use dev for individual experimentation and not abuse the
open access (mitigated by per-engineer resource quotas)
● Staging data sanitisation is reversible-safe — the sanitisation cannot be
reversed to recover original PII (one-way hashing, irreversible
redaction)
● The four-environment set is stable; new environments (DR, sandbox,
training) require an ADR amendment
● Terraform state is isolated per environment (separate S3 state buckets,
separate state locks)

DECISION

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADOPTED
We adopt four environments — dev, test, staging, prod — with strict data
isolation and tiered access controls. (1) dev: local laptop or per-engineer
cloud workspace (AWS Cloud9 or EC2); engineers provision via Terraform
with per-engineer resource quotas (max 1 small PostgreSQL, 1 small Redis,
1 S3 bucket); data is synthetic (seeded by /preone/scripts/seed-dev-data.sh);
access is open to all engineers. (2) test: ephemeral CI/CD environment,
created per pipeline run via Terraform, destroyed after the pipeline
completes; data is synthetic (seeded by test fixtures); access is CI-only (no
human login). (3) staging: persistent pre-prod environment, production-like
infrastructure (same instance types, same Redis cluster mode) at smaller
scale (2 replicas vs prod's 5, db.r5.large vs prod's db.r5.2xlarge); data is a
sanitised copy of prod refreshed weekly via /preone/scripts/refresh-
staging.sh; access is engineering-team-restricted (SSO + MFA). (4) prod:
live production environment, full scale; data is real customer data; access is
on-call-restricted (SSO + MFA + ARB-approved change ticket). Each
environment has isolated infrastructure: separate PostgreSQL instance,
separate Redis cluster, separate S3 bucket, separate IAM roles.
Environment naming follows preone-<env> across all AWS resources (e.g.,
preone-staging-db, preone-staging-redis, preone-staging-s3). Provisioning
is via Terraform with per-environment state (separate S3 state buckets:
preone-terraform-state-dev, preone-terraform-state-test, etc.).
DETAILED RATIONALE
The four-environment model was chosen because it is the minimum that
separates the four concerns (individual experimentation, automated testing,
pre-prod verification, live traffic) without redundancy. The three-environment
option (no separate test) was rejected because CI/CD tests need an ephemeral
environment that does not contend with manual testing — running CI tests
against dev (where engineers are experimenting) produces flaky tests and
engineer frustration, and running them against staging (where integration
testing happens) blocks integration testing during CI runs. The separate test
environment, ephemeral and CI-only, eliminates both problems. The two-
environment option (dev, prod) was rejected because it provides no pre-prod
verification — code goes from dev (synthetic data, no scale) directly to prod
(real data, full scale), missing integration bugs and performance regressions
that only appear at production scale. The pre-v1.0 model was effectively this,
and it produced 3-4 production incidents per quarter that a staging
environment would have caught. The compliance risk of dev-as-staging (real PII
in dev) was a separate, equally-important reason for rejection. The five-
environment option (with DR) was deferred because DR is a Phase 8 concern
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 227

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
(ADR-128). Adding a DR environment now would require decisions about DR
topology (warm standby vs cold standby vs pilot light), RTO/RPO targets, and
DR testing cadence — all of which are out of scope for the v1.0 architecture
foundation. The four-environment model is the foundation; DR is built on top of
it later. The data isolation contract — separate PostgreSQL, Redis, and S3 per
environment — is the most important security decision in this ADR. The pre-
v1.0 model shared a single PostgreSQL instance between dev and prod (with
separate databases within the instance), which produced two near-miss
incidents: an engineer ran a destructive migration against the prod database
(mistaking it for dev) that was caught by a foreign-key constraint, and a dev
script with a hardcoded connection string accidentally connected to prod and
inserted test data into a real customer's table. The four-instance contract (one
PostgreSQL per environment) makes cross-environment connection
structurally impossible — the connection strings are different, the IAM roles
are different, and the security groups are isolated. An engineer who runs a
script with a dev connection string cannot accidentally connect to prod. The
sanitised-copy pipeline is the most operationally complex part of this ADR. The
pipeline (refresh-staging.sh) executes the following steps every Saturday at
02:00 IST: (1) take a snapshot of the prod PostgreSQL instance (AWS RDS
snapshot, ~10 minutes); (2) restore the snapshot to a temporary instance
(preone-staging-refresh-temp, ~30 minutes); (3) run the sanitisation SQL script
against the temporary instance — redact PII columns (parent.name -> 'Parent-'
|| parent.id, parent.email -> 'parent-' || parent.id || '@example.test',
student.name -> 'Student-' || student.id), fuzz financial figures
(payment.amount -> payment.amount * (0.9 + random() * 0.2), rounding to 2
decimals), and truncate sensitive tables (audit logs, session tokens); (4)
pg_dump the sanitised temporary instance and restore it to the staging
instance (overwriting existing staging data, ~60 minutes); (5) destroy the
temporary instance; (6) run staging smoke tests to verify the refresh
succeeded. The total pipeline duration is 2-3 hours, well within the 4-hour
maintenance window. The sanitisation is irreversible (one-way hashing for any
PII that must be preserved as a key, e.g., email -> SHA-256 hash) — even if the
staging database is compromised, the original PII cannot be recovered. The
access-tier model reflects the blast radius of each environment. Dev is open
because a mistake affects only the engineer who made it (their own workspace).
Test is CI-only because human login introduces non-determinism (a human
might modify data that a CI test expects to be in a certain state). Staging is
engineering-team-restricted because a mistake affects the entire team's
integration testing but not customer data. Prod is on-call-restricted because a
mistake affects all customers and the company's reputation. The access tiers
are enforced by AWS IAM (different roles per environment), SSO (different
group membership per environment), and network ACLs (prod is in a separate

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
VPC with no inbound access from the corporate network except via a bastion
host with MFA). The Terraform provisioning (ADR-130) is the enforcement
mechanism for environment isolation. Each environment has its own Terraform
state (separate S3 state bucket), so a Terraform apply against staging cannot
accidentally modify prod. The Terraform modules are shared (the same module
provisions a PostgreSQL instance in dev, test, staging, and prod, with different
parameters), but the state is isolated, preventing cross-environment drift. The
naming convention (preone-<env>-<resource>) is enforced by Terraform
variables, ensuring that resources are visually identifiable by environment — an
engineer seeing 'preone-staging-db' knows immediately it is staging, not prod.
The most likely counter-argument is infrastructure cost: four environments cost
roughly 4x the infrastructure of one environment (more precisely, ~2.5x,
because dev and test are smaller than staging, which is smaller than prod). At
PreOne's scale, this is ~5,000 USD/month in additional AWS cost, which is
justified by the compliance risk reduction (DPDP Act fines up to 30 million USD)
and the incident reduction (3-4 fewer prod incidents per quarter, each costing
~10,000 USD in engineer time + customer impact). The ROI is clear: 60,000
USD/year in infra cost versus 1-2 million USD/year in avoided incidents and
fines.

DATABASE IMPACT
Each environment has its own PostgreSQL instance, with no shared databases,
no shared schemas, and no cross-environment foreign keys. The database
instance types scale with environment: dev uses db.t3.micro (1 vCPU, 1GB
RAM), test uses db.t3.small (1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, ephemeral), staging uses
db.r5.large (2 vCPU, 16GB RAM, production-like configuration), prod uses
db.r5.2xlarge (8 vCPU, 64GB RAM). Flyway migrations (ADR-057) run against
each environment independently — a migration is applied to dev first (manually
by the engineer), then to test (automatically by CI), then to staging (manually
by the release manager during the weekly release window), then to prod
(manually by the on-call engineer during the prod release window). The staging
database is overwritten weekly by the sanitised-copy pipeline, which means any
manual data changes in staging are lost — engineers must use seed scripts
(/preone/scripts/seed-staging-data.sh) for persistent test data, not manual SQL
inserts.
API IMPACT
Each environment has its own API endpoint: api.dev.preone.internal (dev,
internal-only), api.test.preone.internal (test, CI-only),
api.staging.preone.internal (staging, internal + VPN), api.preone.com (prod,
public). The API endpoints are configured via the configuration hierarchy
(ADR-014) — each environment's application-{profile}.yml sets the API base
URL. The frontend uses different API endpoints per environment: dev uses
localhost:8080 or api.dev.preone.internal, staging uses
api.staging.preone.internal, prod uses api.preone.com. The OpenAPI spec is
generated at build time and is identical across environments (the API contract
does not change per environment); only the host and scheme differ. Rate limits
are configured per environment: dev has no rate limits (engineers need to test
freely), test has low rate limits (CI tests are bounded), staging has prod-like rate
limits (to catch rate-limit bugs), prod has the real rate limits.
UI IMPACT
The frontend has per-environment builds: a dev build (with debug tools
enabled, source maps, no minification), a staging build (with debug tools
disabled, source maps, minified), and a prod build (no debug tools, no source
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 231

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
maps, minified + tree-shaken). The build is configured via VITE_ENV
environment variable (set by Terraform per environment). The frontend's API
base URL is injected at build time from the configuration hierarchy (ADR-014),
so the same frontend code can be deployed to any environment with the correct
API endpoint. The frontend does not have access to prod data from non-prod
environments — the API endpoints are isolated, and there is no cross-
environment CORS configuration.
SECURITY IMPACT
The environment strategy is the primary defence against accidental prod data
exposure. The data isolation contract (separate PostgreSQL per environment)
makes cross-environment connection structurally impossible — an engineer
running a script with a dev connection string cannot accidentally connect to
prod, because the connection strings are different, the IAM roles are different,
and the security groups are isolated. The sanitised-copy pipeline ensures that
even staging (which has production-like data) contains no real PII — a staging
database compromise exposes only sanitised data, not real customer data. The
access-tier model enforces least privilege: dev engineers have no prod access,
staging engineers have no prod access, only on-call engineers have prod
access, and only with an ARB-approved change ticket. Prod is in a separate VPC
with no inbound access from the corporate network except via a bastion host
with MFA — direct SSH to prod instances is impossible.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
The environment strategy has no direct runtime performance impact — each
environment's performance is determined by its infrastructure sizing
(PostgreSQL instance type, Redis cluster size, replica count), not by the
environment model. Staging uses production-like infrastructure (db.r5.large, 2
replicas) to catch performance regressions that would only appear at
production scale; the staging performance tests (ADR-150) run weekly against
the sanitised staging data and compare results to the previous week's baseline,
alerting if latency p99 increases by >10% or throughput decreases by >5%.
The sanitised-copy pipeline runs during a maintenance window (Saturday
02:00-06:00 IST) to avoid impacting staging users (who are typically not testing
at 02:00 IST on a Saturday). The pipeline's 2-3 hour duration is acceptable
because staging is not customer-facing.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
The environment strategy scales with the engineering organisation. At 40
engineers (current), dev is per-engineer workspaces (40 small PostgreSQL
instances) — manageable. At 150 engineers (3-year target), dev workspaces
will be 150 instances, which requires per-engineer resource quotas (max 1
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 232

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
small PostgreSQL, max 1 small Redis, max 10GB S3) and automated cleanup of
idle workspaces (workspaces unused for 7 days are auto-destroyed). The test
environment is ephemeral and scales with CI parallelism — at 40 engineers, CI
runs ~200 pipelines/day, each requiring a test environment for ~10 minutes; at
150 engineers, this scales to ~750 pipelines/day. The ephemeral model handles
this naturally (each pipeline gets its own test environment, destroyed after).
Staging and prod are persistent and scale with customer growth, not engineer
growth.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Operations benefit from the environment isolation because incidents are
contained. A destructive script run in dev affects only the engineer's
workspace; the same script run in staging affects only staging (which is rebuilt
weekly by the sanitised-copy pipeline); only a script run in prod affects
customers. The on-call engineer's runbook clearly distinguishes 'this happened
in dev/test/staging, low urgency' from 'this happened in prod, high urgency'.
The sanitised-copy pipeline is monitored weekly — if it fails, staging data
becomes stale (more than 7 days old) and the release manager is alerted to
delay the weekly release until staging is refreshed. The Terraform provisioning
(ADR-130) makes environment recreation possible — if staging is corrupted, it
can be destroyed and recreated from Terraform in ~30 minutes, plus the
sanitised-copy refresh to load data.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
The three-environment option (no separate test) was rejected because CI/CD
tests need an ephemeral environment that does not contend with manual
testing — running CI tests against dev (where engineers are experimenting)
produces flaky tests, and running them against staging (where integration
testing   happens)   blocks   integration   testing   during   CI   runs.   The   two-
environment option (dev, prod) was rejected because it provides no pre-prod
verification and uses real PII in dev (compliance violation). The five-
environment option (with DR) was deferred to ADR-128 because DR is a Phase
8 concern with its own topology decisions (warm standby vs cold standby vs
pilot light) that are out of scope for the v1.0 architecture foundation. The
shared-infrastructure option (one PostgreSQL instance, multiple databases
within) was rejected because it does not provide true isolation — an engineer
with dev credentials can connect to the prod database within the same

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
instance, and a destructive migration can affect multiple environments. The
full-sanitisation option (sanitise all data, including staging) was considered but
rejected because staging needs production-like data volumes to catch
performance bugs — fully synthetic staging data would miss query-plan
regressions that only appear at production scale.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q4 2025) established the four-environment model from the
pre-v1.0 two-environment state. The migration was executed in three phases
over 8 weeks: (1) Phase 1 — provision new environments: Terraform modules
for dev, test, staging were created and applied; the pre-v1.0 'dev' server was
renamed 'staging' and its data was sanitised (replacing the real PII copy with
the first sanitised-copy output); the prod environment was untouched. (2) Phase
2 — implement sanitised-copy pipeline: the refresh-staging.sh script was
written, tested, and scheduled as a weekly cron job; the first refresh took 6
hours (subsequent refreshes optimised to 2-3 hours). (3) Phase 3 — implement
access-tier model: IAM roles were created per environment, SSO groups were
updated, the bastion host was provisioned for prod access. The v3.0 refresh
adds the access-tier formalisation (which was informal in v1.0 — prod access
was 'restricted' but not via ARB-approved change ticket) and the sanitised-copy
refresh contract (which was a script in v1.0, formalised as a contract in v3.0
with monitoring and alerting).
TESTING STRATEGY
The environment strategy is tested at three levels. (1) Infrastructure tests:
Terraform modules are tested with Terratest (ADR-130), which applies the
module to a test AWS account, verifies the resources are created correctly, and
destroys them. (2) Isolation tests: a CI job verifies that no IAM role has cross-
environment access (e.g., the dev role cannot assume the prod role), no security
group allows cross-environment traffic (e.g., dev VPC cannot reach prod VPC),
and no S3 bucket policy allows cross-environment access. (3) Sanitisation tests:
the sanitiser SQL script is tested against a synthetic prod-like dataset (with
known PII patterns), and the output is verified to contain no real PII patterns
(automated PII scanner). Additionally, the sanitised-copy pipeline is end-to-end
tested monthly in a DR-like drill — the pipeline is run manually, and the staging
database is verified to be a correct sanitised copy of prod.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Environments are monitored via infrastructure metrics and pipeline metrics.
Infrastructure metrics (per environment): PostgreSQL CPU/memory/IOPS,
Redis memory/hit-rate, S3 bucket size, EC2 instance count, monthly cost.
Pipeline metrics: sanitised-copy pipeline duration (target: <3 hours), sanitised-
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 236

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
copy pipeline success rate (target: 100% weekly), test environment
creation/destruction count (target: equals CI pipeline count, indicating no
leaks), dev workspace idle count (target: <10 idle workspaces at any time).
Alerts fire on: sanitised-copy pipeline failure (alert release manager, delay
weekly release), sanitised-copy pipeline duration >4 hours (alert DevOps,
investigate), PII scanner detection in staging (alert security team, block
release), test environment leak count >5 (alert DevOps, run cleanup). The cost
per environment is reported monthly and reviewed at the ARB — significant
cost increases trigger an investigation.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The four-environment model is stable; the most likely evolution is the addition
of a DR environment (deferred to ADR-128, Phase 8) and possibly a sandbox
environment for customer-facing demos and training (separate from
dev/test/staging/prod, with synthetic data and no access to internal systems).
The sanitised-copy pipeline may evolve to support more frequent refreshes
(daily instead of weekly) if staging data staleness becomes a release-quality
issue — this would require optimising the pipeline to run in <1 hour, possibly
via PostgreSQL logical replication with continuous sanitisation. The access-tier
model may evolve to support just-in-time prod access (engineers request access
via a ticket, granted for 1 hour, automatically revoked) instead of standing prod
access for on-call engineers — this is a future security hardening, not currently
justified. The environment naming convention (preone-<env>) is stable and
will not change.

DECISION SUMMARY
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 239

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
DECISION
Adopt a custom feature flag system with four flag types — release flags
(dark launch new features), experiment flags (A/B test variants), ops flags
(kill switches and rate limits), and permission flags (tenant-level feature
gating). Flags are stored in PostgreSQL (source of truth) with Redis as a
TTL-based read cache (5-minute TTL) for fast evaluation. Flag evaluation is
server-side: the backend resolves flags and passes the results to the
frontend via a /api/v1/flags endpoint, eliminating client-side flag-polling.
Custom Java and TypeScript SDKs provide typed flag access. Flag lifecycle
follows a strict progression: Proposed (flag exists but is off) -> canary (1
tenant) -> 10% rollout -> 50% rollout -> 100% rollout -> flag removed (code
path permanent). Flags older than 2 months trigger an ADR requiring a
decision to either remove the flag (make the code path permanent) or
extend its life with justification.

CONTEXT
Before v1.0, PreOne had no feature flag system. New features were deployed
'lit up' — code merged to main, deployed to prod, and immediately visible to all
users. If a bug was discovered post-deploy, the only rollback was a code revert
and redeploy, which took 15-30 minutes (build + deploy + smoke test). During
the first 6 months of operation, 4 incidents required code reverts, each
affecting all customers for 15-30 minutes — a total of ~2 hours of customer-
visible downtime that could have been avoided with a kill-switch flag. The team
evaluated LaunchDarkly (the leading commercial feature flag service) and a
custom-built system. LaunchDarkly's strengths (mature SDK, rich dashboard,
A/B testing analytics) were compelling, but the team identified three concerns:
(1) cost — LaunchDarkly's pricing at PreOne's scale (5,000 schools, 50,000
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 240

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
MAU) would be ~2,000 USD/month, growing with user count; (2) data
residency — LaunchDarkly's flag evaluation data flows through their US-based
infrastructure, which may conflict with DPDP Act 2023's data localisation
requirements for child data; (3) vendor lock-in — the LaunchDarkly SDK
becomes pervasive in the codebase, making future migration expensive. The
team concluded that a custom system, built on PostgreSQL and Redis
(infrastructure PreOne already operates), would meet PreOne's needs at lower
cost, with full data residency control, and without vendor lock-in. The v3.0
refresh adds two refinements. First, the flag lifecycle governance rule: every
flag has a lifecycle from Proposed to Removed, with explicit rollout stages
(canary -> 10% -> 50% -> 100%); flags that reach 100% rollout must be
removed within 2 months (the code path becomes permanent), and flags that
have not progressed for 2 months trigger an ADR requiring a decision. This rule
prevents flag accumulation — the gradual buildup of stale flags that no one
remembers why they exist, which is the primary long-term cost of feature flag
systems. Second, the SDK typed-access contract: the Java SDK and TypeScript
SDK generate typed flag accessors from a flag definition file (flags.yml), so
engineers call FeatureFlags.enrollmentV2Enabled() instead of
flags.isEnabled('enrollment-v2') — the flag key is checked at compile time,
preventing typos and enabling IDE refactoring.
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary business driver is incident response speed: a kill-switch flag can
disable a broken feature in <5 seconds (Redis cache update), versus 15-30
minutes for a code revert and redeploy. The 4 pre-v1.0 incidents that required
code reverts would have been resolved in <5 seconds each with kill-switch
flags, saving ~2 hours of customer-visible downtime per quarter. The
secondary driver is release confidence: dark-launching new features (deploying
the code with the flag off, then gradually enabling it) allows the team to verify
the code in production without customer impact, catching integration bugs that
staging missed. The tertiary driver is A/B testing: experiment flags allow
product managers to test feature variants (e.g., new enrollment flow vs old
flow) with a subset of users, measuring conversion before committing to the
new flow.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
PreOne has no feature flag system, requiring code reverts for post-deploy
issues (15-30 minute resolution time) and preventing dark-launch or gradual
rollout of new features. We need a feature flag system that supports four flag
types (release, experiment, ops, permission), evaluates flags server-side for
performance and consistency, uses PostgreSQL + Redis (existing
infrastructure), and has governance to prevent flag accumulation.
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 241

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
CONSTRAINTS
● Flag evaluation must be server-side — the frontend receives resolved
flag values, never evaluates flags itself
● Flag read latency must be <1ms (cached in Redis) — flags are
evaluated on every request that needs them
● Flag updates must propagate within 5 seconds (Redis cache TTL +
cache invalidation on update)
● Flags must support per-tenant targeting (e.g., 'enabled for tenant X' or
'enabled for 10% of tenants')
● Flag definitions must be version-controlled (flags.yml in the monorepo)
— no flag exists without a definition file entry
● Flag lifecycle must be enforced — flags >2 months old trigger an ADR;
flags at 100% rollout must be removed within 2 months
● SDK access must be typed — flag keys are compile-time-checked,
preventing typos
● Custom system, not LaunchDarkly — avoid vendor lock-in and data
residency concerns
ASSUMPTIONS
● PostgreSQL can handle the flag read load (cached in Redis; only cache
misses hit PostgreSQL, ~1 per 5 minutes per flag)
● Redis cache TTL of 5 minutes is acceptable staleness for flag updates
(kill switches propagate within 5 seconds via explicit cache
invalidation, not via TTL expiry)
● Engineers will use the SDK's typed accessors (not raw string-based flag
lookups) — enforced by ArchUnit
● The four flag types (release, experiment, ops, permission) cover all use
cases; new types require an ADR amendment
● Flag definitions change infrequently (new flags added weekly, existing
flags modified rarely) — the flags.yml file is not a hotbed of merge
conflicts
● The flag system is used for runtime toggles only — build-time feature
flags (compile-time exclusion of code) are out of scope and handled by
Gradle build variants

DECISION
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  244

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADOPTED
We adopt a custom feature flag system on PostgreSQL (source of truth) and
Redis (5-minute TTL cache with explicit invalidation on update). Four flag
types are supported: (1) Release flags — dark launch new features; default
off; rolled out via the lifecycle (canary -> 10% -> 50% -> 100%); example:
enrollment-v2. (2) Experiment flags — A/B test variants; default off; rolled
out to a random percentage of users for the experiment duration; example:
enrollment-flow-variant-b. (3) Ops flags — kill switches and rate limits;
default on; toggled off for incident response; example: payments-
processing-enabled (kill switch for the payment module). (4) Permission
flags — tenant-level feature gating; default off; enabled per-tenant via the
tenant configuration; example: advanced-reporting-enabled (gated to
enterprise-tier tenants). Flag evaluation is server-side: the backend
resolves flags via the Java SDK
(FeatureFlags.enrollmentV2Enabled(tenantId, userId)) and passes the
resolved values to the frontend via the /api/v1/flags endpoint (called once on
app load, cached in the frontend for 5 minutes). Custom Java SDK
(com.preone.shared.featureflags.FeatureFlags) and TypeScript SDK
(@preone/feature-flags) provide typed accessors generated from flags.yml.
Flag lifecycle: Proposed (flag exists in flags.yml, off for all) -> canary (on for
1 tenant) -> 10% rollout -> 50% rollout -> 100% rollout -> Removed (flag
removed from flags.yml, code path permanent). Flags >2 months old trigger
an ADR; flags at 100% rollout for >2 months must be removed.
DETAILED RATIONALE
The custom system was chosen over LaunchDarkly because the three concerns
(cost, data residency, vendor lock-in) outweighed LaunchDarkly's maturity
advantage. The cost analysis: LaunchDarkly at PreOne's 5-year horizon (5,000
schools, 50,000 MAU) would cost ~5,000 USD/month (60,000 USD/year),
versus the custom system's ~2 engineer-weeks/year maintenance (~5,000
USD/year engineer time). The 12x cost difference is significant, and the custom
system's maintenance effort does not grow with user count (it grows with flag
count, which is bounded by the lifecycle governance rule). The data residency
concern: LaunchDarkly's flag evaluation data (which users saw which flag
values) flows through their US infrastructure, which may conflict with DPDP
Act 2023's data localisation requirements for child data — even though flag
evaluation data is not PII, the legal team advised that any data flow through US
infrastructure for a child-data platform requires review. The custom system
keeps all flag data in PreOne's AWS account (Mumbai region), eliminating the
concern. The vendor lock-in concern: LaunchDarkly's SDK becomes pervasive
in the codebase (every feature flag check is an SDK call), and migrating away
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 245

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
from LaunchDarkly would require touching every flag check — a multi-week
migration with regression risk. The custom system's SDK is owned by PreOne
and can be modified at any time without vendor coordination. This is not a
theoretical concern — the team has experience migrating off a previous SaaS
monitoring tool that took 6 weeks of engineering effort to remove, despite the
tool being 'easily replaceable' when adopted. The PostgreSQL + Redis
architecture is straightforward. PostgreSQL stores the flag definitions (key,
type, description, default value, targeting rules) and the flag states (current
rollout percentage, per-tenant overrides). Redis caches the flag states with a 5-
minute TTL, providing <1ms read latency for flag evaluations. Flag updates (via
the CLI or web UI) write to PostgreSQL and explicitly invalidate the Redis
cache for the updated flag, ensuring propagation within 5 seconds (the kill-
switch use case). The 5-minute TTL is a fallback for cache invalidation failures
— if the explicit invalidation misses (e.g., Redis was temporarily unavailable
during the update), the TTL ensures the cache is eventually consistent within 5
minutes. The four flag types are designed to cover distinct use cases without
overlap. Release flags are for dark-launching new features — the code is
deployed with the flag off, then gradually enabled. Experiment flags are for A/B
testing — the flag selects between two code paths (variant A vs variant B), and
the experiment's conversion metrics are tracked separately. Ops flags are for
incident response — the flag is on by default and toggled off to disable a feature
during an incident (kill switch) or to reduce load (rate limit). Permission flags
are for tenant-level feature gating — the flag is on for tenants that have
purchased a feature (e.g., advanced reporting) and off for tenants that have not.
The four types have different default values (release: off; experiment: off; ops:
on; permission: per-tenant) and different lifecycle rules (release and
experiment: removed after rollout completes; ops: persistent; permission:
persistent per-tenant). The server-side evaluation decision is the most
important architectural choice in this ADR. Client-side evaluation (the frontend
fetches flag definitions and evaluates flags itself, as LaunchDarkly's client SDK
does) has two problems: (1) the flag definitions (including targeting rules and
rollout percentages) are exposed to the client, which is a security concern for
permission flags (the frontend would know which features the tenant has not
purchased); (2) the frontend must poll for flag updates, adding latency and
complexity. Server-side evaluation resolves both: the frontend receives only the
resolved flag values (not the rules), and the frontend fetches the resolved
values once on app load (via /api/v1/flags) and caches them for 5 minutes. The
cost is one API call on app load, which is acceptable (the call is parallel to other
bootstrap calls and adds <50ms to app startup). The benefit is that the flag
system's internals (rules, percentages, per-tenant overrides) are never exposed
to the client. The SDK typed-access contract (v3.0) is the most operationally
important refinement. In v1.0, flag access was string-based:
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 246

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
flags.isEnabled('enrollment-v2'). This had two problems: (1) typos were not
caught at compile time (flags.isEnabled('enrollment-v2b') would silently return
false, hiding the bug); (2) refactoring was risky (renaming a flag required
grepping the codebase for all string references, which was error-prone). The
v3.0 contract generates typed accessors from flags.yml: the flag definition
enrollment-v2 generates a method
FeatureFlags.enrollmentV2Enabled(tenantId, userId), and any code calling a
non-existent method fails at compile time. The generation is done by a Gradle
plugin (preone-featureflags-codegen) that reads flags.yml and emits Java and
TypeScript source files. This eliminates typos, enables IDE refactoring, and
makes flag usage greppable (every call site is a method call, not a string). The
flag lifecycle governance rule (v3.0) addresses flag accumulation, the primary
long-term cost of feature flag systems. Without governance, flags accumulate:
engineers create flags for new features, the features ship, and the flags are
never removed because 'removing the flag is risky' (the code path that handles
flag-off is still there). Over years, the codebase becomes littered with dead flag
checks, each adding a small amount of complexity and cognitive load. The v3.0
rule requires that flags at 100% rollout be removed within 2 months (the code
path that handles flag-off is deleted, the flag is removed from flags.yml), and
flags that have not progressed for 2 months trigger an ADR requiring a decision
(either progress the rollout, remove the flag, or extend its life with
justification). This rule is enforced by a weekly CI job that scans flags.yml and
the flag state database, identifying flags that violate the rule and failing the
build (for 100% rollout flags) or alerting the ARB (for stalled flags). The rule has
reduced flag count from a projected 200+ (without governance) to a steady-
state ~50 flags (with governance). The most likely counter-argument is that
building a custom system is 'reinventing the wheel' — LaunchDarkly exists and
is mature. The counter-counter-argument is that the custom system is small
(~2,000 lines of code, 4 engineer-weeks initial effort) and the maintenance
effort is low (~2 engineer-weeks/year), while the cost savings (60,000
USD/year) and data residency benefit are significant. The custom system is not
reinventing LaunchDarkly; it is building a small, focused tool that meets
PreOne's specific needs without the overhead of a general-purpose platform.
The team has the expertise (PostgreSQL, Redis, Spring Boot) to build and
maintain it, and the typed SDK codegen is a feature LaunchDarkly does not
offer.

DATABASE IMPACT
Feature flags are stored in two PostgreSQL tables: flag_definitions (key, type,
description, default_value, created_at, lifecycle_stage) and flag_states
(flag_key, tenant_id, override_value, rollout_percentage,
experiment_assignment). The flag_definitions table is conceptually read-only
(definitions come from flags.yml and are synced at deploy time); the flag_states
table is read-write (the Admin CLI and web UI update it). The tables are small
(~50 rows in flag_definitions, ~500 rows in flag_states with per-tenant
overrides for ~10 flags), so no special indexing is needed beyond the primary

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
key (flag_key) and a secondary index on (flag_key, tenant_id) for the per-tenant
lookup. The Redis cache eliminates ~99.99% of PostgreSQL reads (cache hit
rate measured in production), so the PostgreSQL tables are essentially write-
only from the application's perspective — reads happen only on cache miss
(every 5 minutes per flag) or on flag state update (explicit cache invalidation).
API IMPACT
The feature flag system exposes one API endpoint: GET /api/v1/flags, which
returns the resolved flag values for the authenticated user (based on their
tenant_id and user_id). The endpoint is called once on frontend app load and
the result is cached in the frontend for 5 minutes. The endpoint does not expose
flag definitions, targeting rules, or rollout percentages — only the resolved
boolean values. This is a security property: the frontend cannot inspect the flag
system's internals. The endpoint is unauthenticated for non-sensitive flags
(release, experiment) and authenticated for sensitive flags (permission, ops) —
the frontend receives different flag sets based on the user's role. Flag changes
do not require API versioning (the /api/v1/flags endpoint is stable; only the
values change), so flag updates do not affect API compatibility.
UI IMPACT
The frontend integrates with the feature flag system via the TypeScript SDK
(@preone/feature-flags), which provides typed accessors mirroring the Java
SDK. The frontend calls useFeatureFlags() hook on app load, which fetches
/api/v1/flags and caches the result for 5 minutes. Components access flags via
the typed accessors: if (featureFlags.enrollmentV2Enabled()) { render
<EnrollmentV2 /> } else { render <EnrollmentV1 /> }. The typed accessors
are generated from the same flags.yml as the Java SDK, ensuring the frontend
and backend use identical flag keys. The frontend does not poll for flag updates
(the 5-minute cache is sufficient for most use cases); for ops flags that need
faster propagation (e.g., a kill switch for the enrollment module), the frontend
subscribes to a Server-Sent Events stream that pushes flag updates in real
time.
SECURITY IMPACT
The feature flag system improves security posture by enabling kill switches —
an ops flag can disable a vulnerable feature in <5 seconds, without a code
deploy. This is the primary incident-response tool for security incidents: if a
vulnerability is discovered in the payment module, the on-call engineer toggles
the payments-processing-enabled flag off, immediately disabling the module,
and then works on the fix without time pressure. The server-side evaluation
property is a security control: the frontend cannot inspect flag rules or per-
tenant overrides, so a malicious user cannot determine which features other

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
tenants have purchased. The flag system's admin access (CLI and web UI) is
restricted to engineering team leads and the on-call rotation; flag changes are
logged to the audit table (audit_log) with the changer's identity, the flag key,
the old value, and the new value — every flag change is auditable.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
The feature flag system adds <1ms to request latency for flag evaluations
(Redis cache hit). The cache hit rate is >99.99% (measured in production), so
PostgreSQL reads are rare (~1 per 5 minutes per flag, ~10 reads per minute
total across all flags). The flag state write path (Admin CLI -> PostgreSQL ->
Redis invalidation) takes ~50ms, which is acceptable for an admin operation.
The /api/v1/flags endpoint adds <50ms to app startup (one Redis read for all
flags, returned as a JSON object). The frontend caches the flag values for 5
minutes, eliminating per-request flag fetches. Overall, the performance impact
is negligible — the flag system is designed to be 'free' at runtime, with all the
cost in the admin path (which is rare).
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
The feature flag system scales with flag count, not with user count. The Redis
cache size is ~50 flags * 1KB per flag = ~50KB, trivially small. The PostgreSQL
tables are ~50 rows in flag_definitions and ~500 rows in flag_states, trivially
small. The flag evaluation latency is constant (<1ms) regardless of user count,
because the evaluation is a Redis lookup followed by a hash function (for rollout
percentage). The /api/v1/flags endpoint scales with concurrent app loads (each
load fetches flags once), but the Redis cache handles this easily (Redis can
serve 100,000+ reads per second). The flag system will not be a scaling
bottleneck at any projected PreOne scale. The flag count is bounded by the
lifecycle governance rule (~50 steady-state flags), preventing unbounded
growth.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Operations benefit from the feature flag system's kill-switch capability — the
on-call engineer can disable a broken feature in <5 seconds via the Admin CLI
(preone flags set payments-processing-enabled false --env prod), without a code
deploy. This is the primary operational value of the system. The flag system is
monitored via standard metrics: Redis cache hit rate (target: >99%), flag
evaluation latency (target: <1ms p99), flag state update latency (target:
<50ms), /api/v1/flags endpoint latency (target: <50ms p99). The lifecycle
governance rule is monitored by a weekly CI job that produces a flag-age
report, identifying flags that are approaching the 2-month threshold and
alerting their owners. The flag system has a runbook for common operations

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
LaunchDarkly was rejected because the cost (60,000 USD/year at 5-year
horizon), data residency concerns (US data flow), and vendor lock-in (pervasive
SDK) outweighed the maturity advantage. Open-source flag services (Unleash,
Flagsmith) were rejected because they introduce a new critical infrastructure
dependency (the flag service must be up for the app to start) and are less
customisable than a custom system. Spring Cloud Config without Redis was
rejected for insufficient performance (5-10ms per flag evaluation vs the <1ms
requirement) and insufficient propagation speed (30-second refresh vs 5-
second kill-switch requirement). The custom system was chosen because
PreOne already operates PostgreSQL and Redis (no new infrastructure), the
system is small (~2,000 lines of code), and the typed SDK codegen is a feature
no commercial or open-source system offers. The team has the expertise to
build and maintain it, and the lifecycle governance rule prevents the long-term
cost (flag accumulation) that plagues undisciplined flag systems.
MIGRATION PLAN
The v1.0 migration (Q4 2025) built the feature flag system from scratch, since
there was no pre-v1.0 flag system to migrate from. The migration was executed
in three phases over 6 weeks: (1) Phase 1 — build the core: PostgreSQL tables,
Redis cache, Flag Service (Spring component), Java SDK with string-based
accessors (typed accessors added in v3.0). (2) Phase 2 — adopt for new
features: new features deployed after v1.0 use release flags for dark launch; the
first 5 flags were created for the v1.1 release (enrollment-v2, billing-recurring-
payments, attendance-biometric, reporting-real-time, notification-whatsapp).
(3) Phase 3 — retrofit kill switches: ops flags were added to existing critical
paths (payments-processing-enabled, enrollment-enabled, attendance-enabled)
as kill switches. The v3.0 refresh adds the typed SDK codegen (which was
string-based in v1.0) and the lifecycle governance rule (which was informal in
v1.0 — flags were 'encouraged to be removed' but not enforced). The v3.0
migration refactored all string-based flag lookups to typed accessors, a 1-week
effort touching ~100 call sites.
TESTING STRATEGY
The feature flag system is tested at three levels. (1) Unit tests: the Flag Service
is unit-tested with mocked Redis and PostgreSQL, verifying flag evaluation
logic (default value, per-tenant override, rollout percentage hash). The rollout
percentage hash is tested for uniform distribution (10,000 random tenant IDs,
10% rollout, assert ~1,000 are enabled). (2) Integration tests: the Flag Service
is integration-tested with real Redis (Testcontainers) and real PostgreSQL
(Testcontainers), verifying cache hit/miss behavior and cache invalidation on
update. The /api/v1/flags endpoint is integration-tested with real
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 254

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
authentication, verifying that the correct flag set is returned per user role. (3)
End-to-end tests: a flag is created, enabled for a canary tenant, and an E2E test
verifies that the canary tenant sees the new feature and other tenants do not.
The lifecycle governance rule is tested by a CI job that creates a flag, sets its
lifecycle_stage to '100% rollout' with a created_at 3 months ago, and verifies
that the build fails (enforcing the removal rule).
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
The feature flag system is monitored via standard metrics: Redis cache hit rate
(target: >99%, alert if <95%), flag evaluation latency (target: <1ms p99, alert if
>5ms), flag state update latency (target: <50ms, alert if >200ms), /api/v1/flags
endpoint latency (target: <50ms p99, alert if >200ms), flag count (target: <75
steady-state, alert if >100 indicating governance failure), flag age distribution
(target: median <60 days, alert if median >90 days). The lifecycle governance
rule produces a weekly flag-age report, listing every flag with its age, lifecycle
stage, and owner, sent to the ARB for review. Flag changes are logged to the
audit table and surfaced in a Grafana dashboard showing flag change frequency
(alert if >10 changes/day in prod, indicating instability).
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The feature flag system is stable; the most likely evolution is the addition of
experiment analytics (for A/B testing). Currently, experiment flags select
between variants but the conversion metrics are tracked manually (via custom
analytics events); a future ADR may add built-in experiment analytics
(statistical significance calculation, variant comparison dashboard). Another
possible evolution is the addition of progressive delivery (linking flag rollout to
deployment, so a new version is deployed to the canary tenant first, then 10%,
etc., automatically based on health metrics). This is a Phase 7 concern
(Deployment & Release Management) and is not part of the current system. The
flag types (release, experiment, ops, permission) are stable; new types (e.g.,
'migration flags' for database migrations) would require an ADR amendment.
The typed SDK codegen may evolve to support additional languages (Python for
data engineering scripts) if those scripts need flag access.

DECISION SUMMARY
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  257

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
DECISION
Adopt GitHub Actions as the canonical CI/CD platform for the PreOne
platform, with a 10-stage Gradle-based build pipeline that produces Docker
images for backend, static assets for frontend, and Flyway migrations as
deployable artifacts. Build targets: PR pipelines under 10 minutes, main-
branch pipelines under 15 minutes.

CONTEXT
Before v1.0, PreOne's build process was a mix of local Gradle runs, a Jenkins
server maintained by one DevOps engineer, and an ad-hoc shell script that
wrapped npm and docker. Builds took 25-40 minutes on average, flaked 15% of
the time due to environment drift between Jenkins and local machines, and
produced artifacts that were not reproducible (a build of the same commit
could produce different images because dependencies were resolved at build
time without lockfiles). Three separate teams maintained three separate build
scripts, each with subtle differences in test scope, linting rules, and artifact
naming. The Office of the Chief Architect identified build pipeline unification as
a Q3 2025 priority. The goals were: (1) a single pipeline definition for the entire
platform; (2) reproducible artifacts (deterministic builds); (3) build time under
10 minutes for PR feedback; (4) pipeline-as-code so the pipeline itself is
versioned alongside the application code; (5) self-service for feature teams (no
DevOps bottleneck for adding a new test stage). The evaluation considered
Jenkins (existing), GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, and Buildkite. The
evaluation concluded that GitHub Actions was the right choice: it lives next to
the code (no separate CI server to maintain), it has first-class support for the
GitHub workflow (PRs, branch protection, required checks), its runner
marketplace covers our needs (Java, Node, Docker, AWS), and its pricing scales

with usage without per-seat licensing. The 10-stage pipeline was designed to
give fast feedback (lint and unit tests in <3 minutes) while still catching
integration and security issues before merge to main.
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary driver is developer productivity: a 25-minute build means a
developer waits half an hour to know if their PR is viable, which kills iteration
speed and encourages context-switching. A sub-10-minute PR pipeline restores
the tight feedback loop that small teams enjoy. The secondary driver is release
confidence: a deterministic pipeline with security scans, contract tests, and
ArchUnit boundary checks produces artifacts that are safe to deploy without
manual review. The tertiary driver is operational cost: a single GitHub Actions
pipeline replaces the Jenkins server (which required ~10 hours/month of
DevOps maintenance) and the three team-specific build scripts (~6
hours/month of duplication). The combined saving is roughly one full-time
engineer's worth of toil redirected to feature work.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
PreOne's build process is slow (25-40 minutes), flaky (15% failure rate), non-
reproducible (same commit yields different artifacts), and fragmented (three
teams maintain three scripts). We need a single, fast, deterministic, pipeline-as-
code build that produces deployable artifacts with confidence.
CONSTRAINTS
● PR build must complete in under 10 minutes (developer feedback loop)
● Main-branch build must complete in under 15 minutes (release
cadence)
● Pipeline must run on GitHub-hosted runners (no self-hosted
infrastructure to maintain)
● Artifacts must be reproducible — same commit + lockfile = same image
digest
● Pipeline definition must live in the same repository as the application
code
● All stages must be parallelisable where dependencies allow (module-
level test fan-out)
● Build cache must persist across runs (Gradle, npm, Docker layers)
ASSUMPTIONS
● GitHub Actions remains available and pricing remains usage-based (no
per-seat surprise)

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
● GitHub-hosted runner performance is sufficient for our build size (200k
LOC, ~5,000 tests)
● AWS ECR is available as the artifact registry (same AWS account as
deployment)
● Engineers will respect the pipeline as the source of truth (no local-
release shortcuts)
● Lockfiles (Gradle lockfile, package-lock.json) are maintained and
committed
● Modular monolith topology holds (single deployable, so single build
artifact for backend)

DECISION
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  261

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADOPTED
We adopt GitHub Actions as the canonical CI/CD platform, with a 10-stage
Gradle-based pipeline defined in .github/workflows/build.yml. The pipeline
stages are: (1) lint (Checkstyle, PMD, ESLint, Prettier); (2) compile (Gradle
build for backend, tsc for frontend); (3) unit tests (JUnit 5 for backend, Jest
for frontend); (4) integration tests (Testcontainers with PostgreSQL 16 and
Redis 7); (5) contract tests (Pact consumer and provider verification); (6)
ArchUnit boundary checks (module dependency rules per ADR-007); (7)
security scan (Trivy for image CVEs, Snyk for dependency CVEs, GitHub
CodeQL for SAST); (8) package (Docker image build, push to ECR with
immutable tag = git SHA); (9) deploy to test environment (ECS Fargate,
ADR-018); (10) smoke tests (health check, key user journeys). Build
caching: Gradle cache (actions/cache keyed on gradle.lockfile), npm cache
(actions/cache keyed on package-lock.json), Docker layer cache
(actions/cache keyed on Dockerfile hash). Parallel jobs: backend and
frontend pipelines run as parallel workflow jobs; within backend, unit tests
fan out per module via Gradle's test partitioning. Build badge in
README.md links to the GitHub Actions status page.
DETAILED RATIONALE
GitHub Actions was chosen because the marginal cost of switching from
Jenkins (the existing tool) is paid back within 3 months by the elimination of
Jenkins maintenance. The native GitHub integration — PR checks, branch
protection, required-status-checks, CODEOWNERS — removes an entire class
of integration glue that Jenkins requires. The 10-stage design reflects a
deliberate ordering: fast-fail stages first (lint, compile, unit tests) so developers
get feedback within 3 minutes; expensive stages last (security scan, deploy,
smoke) so they only run on commits that have already passed cheap checks.
The stage ordering is the result of analysing 6 months of Jenkins build data. The
number-one cause of build failure was lint (40% of failures), and lint is the
cheapest stage (~30 seconds). Number two was unit tests (25% of failures, ~3
minutes). By front-loading these, 65% of build failures are caught in under 4
minutes — the developer gets the failure feedback before they have context-
switched away from the PR. The expensive stages (integration, contract,
security) catch the remaining 35% of failures but only run on commits that have
passed the cheap stages, saving ~12 minutes of runner time per failing build.
The cache strategy is critical for the sub-10-minute target. Without caching, a
cold Gradle build of PreOne is 8 minutes; with Gradle cache (dependency
downloads cached, build outputs cached), it drops to 2 minutes. Without
Docker layer cache, image build is 6 minutes; with layer cache (base image,
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 262

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
dependencies layer, source layer), it drops to 90 seconds. The cache key
strategy (hash of lockfile for dependency cache, hash of Dockerfile for layer
cache) ensures cache invalidation happens exactly when dependencies change
— no stale cache, no wasted cache misses. The reproducibility requirement is
enforced by three mechanisms: (1) Gradle lockfile (gradle.lockfile) pins every
transitive dependency to a specific version; (2) npm package-lock.json does the
same for frontend; (3) Docker builds use --digest-pin so base images are pulled
by digest, not by tag (so a base image update cannot silently change our build).
Combined, these ensure that two builds of the same commit produce bit-
identical Docker images, verifiable by comparing image digests in ECR. The
ArchUnit stage (stage 6) is the architectural backstop. Per ADR-002 (Modular
Monolith) and ADR-007 (Dependency Rules), module boundaries must be
enforced in CI, not just in code review. ArchUnit tests run as part of the unit-test
suite but are given their own stage label so failures are visible as 'architecture
violation' rather than generic 'test failure'. This makes boundary violations a
first-class pipeline concern, not a side effect. The security scan stage (stage 7)
runs three tools in parallel: Trivy scans the built Docker image for known CVEs
in OS packages and application dependencies; Snyk scans the dependency tree
(Gradle and npm) for CVEs with upgrade guidance; GitHub CodeQL performs
SAST on the source code for vulnerability patterns (SQL injection, XSS,
hardcoded secrets). The three tools are complementary — Trivy catches image-
layer CVEs, Snyk catches dependency CVEs, CodeQL catches code-level
vulnerabilities. Failures are categorised by severity: critical and high block the
build; medium and low produce warnings that go to a security dashboard for
triage.

DATABASE IMPACT
The build pipeline does not directly mutate production databases, but it
produces Flyway migration artifacts that are deployed by ADR-018's
deployment stage. Flyway migration files (V<timestamp>__<description>.sql)
live in src/main/resources/db/migration and are packaged into the Docker
image. The build pipeline runs Flyway's `validate` task (verifies migration
checksums match the schema history table) as part of stage 4 (integration
tests) to catch checksum drift before deploy. Migrations are forward-only per
ADR-019 (Versioning Policy); the build does not produce rollback migrations
because rollback is handled at the deployment layer via blue-green swap to the
previous image.
API IMPACT
The build pipeline runs Pact contract tests in stage 5: consumer-side tests
verify that API consumers (frontend, internal modules) generate expected
pacts; provider-side tests verify that the API implementation honours those
pacts. Pacts are published to a Pact Broker (hosted internally) tagged with the
git SHA. A PR that breaks a contract is blocked by the provider-verification
step. The build also generates OpenAPI specs from the code (springdoc-
openapi) and verifies them against the committed spec file — drift between
code and spec is a build failure, enforcing ADR-001 principle P7 (Contracts
Before Code).
UI IMPACT
Frontend builds (TypeScript compile, Vite production bundle, ESLint, Prettier,
Jest unit tests) run as a parallel GitHub Actions job. The build produces static
assets (HTML, JS, CSS, source maps) that are uploaded to S3 and served via
CloudFront. Source maps are uploaded to a private S3 bucket for error
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 265

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
reporting (Sentry) but not deployed publicly (to avoid leaking source code). The
build also runs Lighthouse CI on the production bundle, measuring
performance, accessibility, and SEO scores; a regression of >5 points on any
metric blocks the build.
SECURITY IMPACT
Stage 7 (security scan) is the primary security gate. Trivy scans the Docker
image for OS-package CVEs and application-dependency CVEs (Java JARs,
Node modules). Snyk scans the dependency graph for CVEs with upgrade
paths. GitHub CodeQL performs SAST on source for patterns like SQL
injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, insecure deserialization. Results are
uploaded as SARIF to GitHub Security tab for triage. Critical and high severity
findings block the build; medium and low produce warnings. Secrets are never
in the repo — GitHub OIDC is used to assume AWS IAM roles for ECR push and
ECS deploy, eliminating long-lived AWS credentials.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
The pipeline is designed for sub-10-minute PR builds. Stage timings (with
cache): lint 30s, compile 90s, unit tests 3min (fan-out per module), integration
4min, contract + ArchUnit 2min, security 2min, package 90s, deploy + smoke
2min — total ~16min sequential, but with parallelism (backend/frontend jobs in
parallel, security scans in parallel, unit-test fan-out) the wall-clock time is ~9
minutes for PRs (security and deploy stages skipped on PR) and ~13 minutes
for main (all stages). The cache hit rate is monitored; a drop below 80% triggers
a review of cache key strategy.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
The pipeline scales horizontally via GitHub Actions' concurrent job limit. The
PreOne organisation has 20 concurrent runner slots (paid plan). At peak (10
engineers pushing PRs simultaneously), the pipeline queues for ~2 minutes
before a runner is free — acceptable. Module-level test fan-out uses 4 partitions
(not 12) to balance fan-out benefit against runner-slot consumption. The
pipeline definition scales with the codebase: new modules add a Gradle
subproject and automatically inherit the pipeline stages (no per-module
pipeline definition needed). Build cache scales with cache size: at 5GB cache
limit, we evict oldest entries first; cache hit rate is the primary scaling metric.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
The pipeline is operated by the DevOps team (2 engineers) with on-call rotation.
Failures are categorised: infrastructure failures (runner offline, ECR
unavailable) page the DevOps on-call; build failures (lint, test, security) notify
the PR author via GitHub. The pipeline has a 30-day retention on build logs
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 266

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
(GitHub Actions default); long-term retention is via export to CloudWatch Logs.
The pipeline is itself versioned (build.yml in repo), so changes go through PR
review — no out-of-band pipeline changes. A nightly 'main' build runs the full
pipeline including slow tests (performance, end-to-end) that are skipped on PR
for speed.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
Jenkins was rejected because the maintenance burden (10 hours/month) and
integration friction (no native GitHub PR support) were not justified by the
control it offered. GitLab CI was rejected because migrating the repository off

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
GitHub would disrupt the product team's PR review workflow and offer no
significant advantage at our scale. CircleCI was rejected on cost grounds — per-
seat pricing penalises growth, and the per-minute pricing of GitHub Actions is
cheaper at our build volume (~200 builds/day). Buildkite was rejected because
self-hosted runners reintroduce the infrastructure burden that we are trying to
eliminate. The chosen approach (GitHub Actions) is not the 'best' CI tool in
absolute terms — it is the best fit for our constraints (GitHub-hosted code, small
DevOps team, usage-based cost tolerance).
MIGRATION PLAN
The migration from Jenkins to GitHub Actions was completed in Q3 2025 over 6
weeks. Phase 1 (week 1-2): parallel run — both Jenkins and GitHub Actions ran
on every PR, results compared for parity. Phase 2 (week 3-4): GitHub Actions
became the required check; Jenkins ran in shadow mode for telemetry only.
Phase 3 (week 5-6): Jenkins decommissioned; the Jenkins server was
repurposed as a build-cache mirror. The v3.0 refresh adds the security scan
stage (Trivy, Snyk, CodeQL) which was not in v1.0, and introduces the
Lighthouse CI check for frontend performance regression.
TESTING STRATEGY
The pipeline itself is tested via a 'pipeline-on-pipeline' approach: a meta-
workflow runs weekly that exercises every stage of build.yml with synthetic
inputs (a known-good commit, a known-bad commit) and verifies that the
pipeline produces the expected pass/fail. Stage-level tests: lint rules are tested
with positive and negative cases (a code snippet that should pass, one that
should fail); ArchUnit rules are tested with synthetic module structures;
security scans are tested with intentionally vulnerable test projects (OWASP
WebGoat Java snippet, npm vulnerable-package fixture). Smoke tests verify the
test environment deployment: health endpoint returns 200, key user journeys
(login, view dashboard, create enrollment) return expected responses.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Pipeline metrics are exported to CloudWatch via a GitHub Actions workflow
that runs after every build and posts build duration, stage durations, pass/fail,
and cache hit rate. Grafana dashboard 'CI/CD Health' shows: (a) build duration
p50/p90 over time (target: p50 < 10min, p90 < 15min); (b) build failure rate by
stage (target: <5% overall); (c) cache hit rate per cache (target: >80%); (d)
runner queue time (target: <2min p90); (e) security scan findings trend (target:
critical findings → 0). Alerts fire on: build duration p90 > 15min, failure rate
>10%, cache hit rate <60%, runner queue >5min p90. Weekly report to
engineering leadership on pipeline health.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 269

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
The pipeline is expected to evolve in three directions. (1) Build time
optimisation: as the codebase grows past 500k LOC, Gradle's incremental build
and configuration cache will become necessary; the v3.0 pipeline already uses
Gradle configuration cache. (2) Security expansion: SLSA (Supply-chain Level
for Software Artifacts) Level 3 compliance is a likely future requirement — the
pipeline already produces provenance attestations (SLSA generator action);
full Level 3 requires isolated builds and verified provenance, a v4.0 candidate.
(3) Multi-platform: if PreOne adds a mobile app (React Native) or a desktop app
(Electron), the pipeline will gain parallel jobs for those platforms; the current
job-based structure scales naturally. No supersession of this ADR is expected
within 24 months.

DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Adopt blue-green deployment on AWS ECS Fargate with an Application
Load Balancer (ALB) routing traffic between two target groups. Deploy
sequence: build new image, push to ECR, spin up green tasks, wait for
health checks, shift traffic 10% to 50% to 100% over 30 minutes, drain blue.
Rollback is instant via target group swap. Database migrations are forward-
only via Flyway and must be backward-compatible.

CONTEXT
Before v1.0, PreOne deployed via an in-house shell script that SSH'd into EC2
instances, pulled the latest Docker image, ran `docker-compose up -d`, and
prayed. Deployments took 20-40 minutes, caused 1-5 minutes of user-visible
downtime, and had no rollback — a bad deploy meant a frantic `git revert`
followed by another 30-minute deploy. The team averaged 1 deploy per week to
production, not because the business wanted slow releases, but because
deploys were risky and time-consuming. The Office of the Chief Architect
evaluated deployment strategies in Q3 2025: rolling deploy, blue-green,
canary, and A/B. PreOne's constraints — modular monolith (single deployable),
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 272

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
AWS infrastructure, small DevOps team, regulatory need for fast rollback —
pointed to blue-green as the right fit. Blue-green gives instant rollback (swap
target group), zero user-visible downtime (green tasks start before blue
drains), and operational simplicity (one ALB, two target groups, no canary
analysis tooling required). The decision to use ECS Fargate (not EKS, not EC2)
was driven by the operational simplicity requirement. Fargate is serverless
container compute — no EC2 instances to patch, no Kubernetes control plane to
operate, no autoscaling groups to tune. The team's DevOps capacity (2
engineers) cannot support a Kubernetes cluster at production-grade reliability.
Fargate trades a small per-task cost premium (~20% over EC2) for a 90%
reduction in operational burden. At PreOne's scale (~20 tasks across 3
environments), the cost premium is ~$400/month — a fraction of an engineer's
salary.
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary driver is deploy frequency: the business wants to ship features 2-3
times per week to production, not once per week. Blue-green with 30-minute
traffic shifting makes each deploy low-risk enough to hit that cadence. The
secondary driver is rollback speed: a regulatory incident (e.g., child data
exposed by a bug) requires rollback in under 5 minutes; blue-green target-
group swap meets this — the rollback is one AWS CLI call. The tertiary driver is
developer confidence: engineers ship more carefully when deploys are scary; a
safe, reversible deploy process lets engineers ship smaller, more frequent
changes, which are inherently less risky than large batch deploys.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
PreOne's deploy process is slow (20-40 minutes), causes downtime (1-5 minutes
per deploy), has no rollback, and limits deploy frequency to once per week. We
need a deployment model that is fast (<10 minutes), zero-downtime, instantly
reversible, and supports 2-3 deploys per week to production.
CONSTRAINTS
● Zero user-visible downtime on every deploy (no maintenance windows)
● Rollback in under 5 minutes (regulatory incident response
requirement)
● Deploy frequency: 2-3 per week to production, daily to staging
● Database migrations must be forward-only (no rollback migrations, per
ADR-019)
● Migrations must be backward-compatible (old code must work on new
schema)
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 273

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
● Deploy must not require DevOps engineer on-call (self-service for
feature teams)
● AWS infrastructure in ap-south-1 (Mumbai) region for data residency
ASSUMPTIONS
● Traffic shifting via ALB weighted target groups is sufficient (no canary
analysis needed)
● ECS Fargate task startup time (60-90 seconds) is acceptable for green
warmup
● Database schema changes are backward-compatible (enforced by
ADR-019 and code review)
● Feature flags (ADR-016) decouple deploy from release (a deployed
feature can be dark)
● The modular monolith topology holds (single deployable, not per-
module deploys)
● AWS ECS Fargate remains available (multi-AZ deployment mitigates AZ
failure)

DECISION
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  275

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ADOPTED
We adopt blue-green deployment on AWS ECS Fargate with an Application
Load Balancer (ALB) routing traffic between two target groups (blue and
green). Deploy sequence: (1) build new Docker image, push to ECR with
immutable tag = git SHA; (2) create new ECS task definition referencing
the new image; (3) spin up green tasks (parallel to blue, in the same ECS
service but a separate task set, or a separate service); (4) wait for ALB
health checks to pass on all green tasks (target group healthy threshold
met); (5) shift traffic from blue to green: 10% for 5 minutes, 50% for 10
minutes, 100% for 15 minutes — total 30 minutes; (6) drain blue tasks
(deregister from old target group, wait for connection drain, stop tasks); (7)
blue target group becomes the standby for the next deploy. Rollback: shift
ALB listener back to blue target group — instant, one AWS CLI call.
Database migrations: Flyway runs as an ECS Run Task before traffic shift,
must be backward-compatible (old code reads new schema correctly).
Feature flags (ADR-016) decouple deploy from release. Deploy frequency:
2-3 per week to prod, daily to staging.
DETAILED RATIONALE
Blue-green was chosen over rolling because rollback speed is a hard constraint.
A rolling deploy's rollback is a re-deploy of the previous image, which takes 10-
15 minutes — too slow for a regulatory incident response. Blue-green's rollback
is a target-group swap, which takes 10 seconds (the time for the ALB to update
its listener rule). This 90x difference in rollback speed is the deciding factor.
The double-resource cost during the 30-minute shift window is acceptable: at
PreOne's task count (~10 tasks per environment), running 20 tasks for 30
minutes costs ~$0.50 per deploy — negligible versus the business value of fast
rollback. ECS Fargate was chosen over EKS for operational simplicity. The
team's DevOps capacity (2 engineers) cannot operate a production-grade
Kubernetes cluster. EKS requires: control plane management (AWS-managed
but still requires version upgrades), worker node group management
(autoscaling groups, AMI updates, security patching), Ingress controller
management (ALB Ingress Controller or Istio), and Kubernetes RBAC. Fargate
eliminates all of this: AWS manages the compute, networking, and scaling; we
just define task definitions and services. The cost premium (~20% over EC2,
~$400/month) is a fraction of the engineer-time saved (~80 hours/month of K8s
operations). Canary was rejected because it requires canary analysis tooling
(Flagger, Istio, or custom Prometheus queries) that the team cannot operate at
production reliability. Blue-green's traffic shifting (10% to 50% to 100%)
provides similar risk reduction without the tooling burden: if green has a high
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 276

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
error rate, the human operator (or the deploy script) halts the shift and rolls
back. This is less automated than canary analysis but is operationally simpler —
appropriate for a small DevOps team. The 30-minute traffic shift (10% for 5
min, 50% for 10 min, 100% for 15 min) is calibrated to PreOne's traffic pattern.
The 10% phase catches catastrophic failures (crash-on-startup, immediate
error rate spike) within 5 minutes, affecting only ~5% of users (10% of traffic
for 5 minutes, but most users don't notice a 5-minute blip). The 50% phase
catches subtler failures (memory leak, slow degradation) within 10 minutes.
The 100% phase is the final commitment; after 15 minutes of clean 100%
traffic, blue is drained. Total shift time: 30 minutes — fast enough to keep
deploy cadence (3 deploys/week fits in business hours), slow enough to catch
real failures. Database migration compatibility is the hardest constraint.
Flyway runs as an ECS Run Task before the green tasks start — it applies
pending migrations to the shared database. The blue tasks are still running on
the old code, so the new schema must be readable by the old code. This rules
out breaking changes: dropping columns, renaming columns, changing types.
The allowed patterns are: add nullable column (old code ignores it), add table
(old code doesn't know about it), add index (no impact), rename via two-phase
(add new column, backfill, switch code, drop old column in a later deploy).
ADR-019 (Versioning Policy) formalises this as a rule: every migration must be
backward-compatible with the previous N-1 code version. Feature flags
(ADR-016) are the secret weapon that makes blue-green viable for risky
features. A feature can be deployed to production (green tasks running new
code) but hidden behind a feature flag (default off). The flag is turned on for
internal testers, then a small percentage of users, then 100%. If the feature
misbehaves, the flag is turned off — no deploy, no rollback. This decouples
deploy (rolling out new code) from release (turning on new behaviour), giving
the team the safety of slow releases with the speed of frequent deploys.

DATABASE IMPACT
Database migrations are forward-only via Flyway (ADR-019). The critical
constraint is backward compatibility: the new schema must be readable by the
old code (blue tasks still running) and by the new code (green tasks). Allowed
migrations: add nullable column, add table, add index, add check constraint
(validated), widen column (VARCHAR(255) to VARCHAR(500)). Forbidden
migrations: drop column, rename column, change column type, narrow column,
add NOT NULL without default. The pattern for breaking changes is two-phase:
deploy 1 adds new column and backfills; deploy 2 switches code to use new
column; deploy 3 drops old column. Flyway runs as an ECS Run Task before the
green tasks start — if Flyway fails, the deploy aborts before any traffic shifts.
API IMPACT
The API is served by both blue and green during the 30-minute shift window.
This means API consumers may hit blue or green on consecutive requests (the
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 279

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
ALB does not guarantee session affinity). The API must therefore be backward-
compatible within a major version (ADR-019): no breaking changes within
/api/v1/. New endpoints and new optional fields are safe; renamed fields or
removed fields are not. Feature flags (ADR-016) gate new API behaviour: a new
endpoint can be deployed (green) but return 404 until the flag is enabled, at
which point both blue and green return 200 (blue falls back to a stub or returns
404 consistently until drained).
UI IMPACT
The UI is served from S3+CloudFront, which is independent of the backend
blue-green deploy. The UI deploy (npm run build, sync to S3, CloudFront
invalidation) is a separate pipeline stage from the backend deploy. The UI must
work with both blue and green API versions during the shift window — this is
enforced by contract tests (ADR-149) that verify the UI's expected pacts against
both versions. If the UI requires a new API field, the deploy sequence is: (1)
deploy backend with new field (green); (2) shift backend to 100% green; (3)
deploy new UI. The reverse (UI first) is forbidden because old backend cannot
serve new UI's expected fields.
SECURITY IMPACT
Blue-green improves security by enabling fast rollback of a vulnerable deploy.
If a security issue is discovered post-deploy, the rollback is a 10-second target-
group swap — no need to wait for a fix-deploy. This reduces the window of
exposure from hours (re-deploy of old image) to seconds (target-group swap).
The trade-off is that both blue and green task sets run during the shift, doubling
the attack surface for 30 minutes — mitigated by both task sets having identical
security configuration (same IAM role, same security groups, same network
policies). Secrets are rotated independently of deploys via AWS Secrets
Manager; the deploy does not touch secrets.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
Blue-green has minimal performance impact. During the 30-minute shift, both
blue and green tasks run, so total capacity is 2x normal — this is a non-issue
because we size for peak load with headroom. Green task startup (60-90
seconds for JVM warmup) is hidden from users — the tasks are registered in the
green target group only after the ALB health check passes (which requires the
JVM to be warm and ready to serve requests). The 10% traffic shift phase is the
first real-user test; if green has a memory leak or performance regression, it
shows up as elevated latency on green tasks (visible in CloudWatch metrics per
target group), and the shift halts for investigation.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 280

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
Blue-green scales with the modular monolith's horizontal scaling (ADR-126).
The number of tasks per environment is determined by the ECS service's
desired count, which is set by an autoscaling policy based on CPU and memory.
Blue-green does not change the scaling model — it just doubles the task count
temporarily during the shift. At PreOne's scale (10 tasks per environment, 3
environments), the 30-minute shift adds 10 tasks of capacity, costing
~$0.50/deploy. The ceiling is the ECS Fargate service quota (500 tasks per
cluster) — well above our peak of 60 tasks (3 environments x 10 tasks x 2 for
blue+green). Database connections are the real ceiling: each task opens 10
connections, so 20 tasks = 200 connections, within PostgreSQL's
max_connections=1000 (with PgBouncer pooling, the ceiling extends to 5000).
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Deploys are operated by the feature team that authored the change, not by a
dedicated release engineer. The deploy is triggered by merging a PR to main
(automated) or by a manual `deploy` GitHub Actions workflow dispatch (for
staging or hotfix). The deploy script (Terraform-managed ECS task definitions
+ AWS CLI for ALB listener rule updates) is reviewed in PR like any other code.
On-call engineers are paged if: deploy fails (Flyway error, task startup failure,
health check timeout), error rate on green >1% during shift, or rollback is
triggered. The on-call engineer's job during a deploy is to monitor CloudWatch
dashboards (per-target-group error rate, latency, CPU) and abort the shift if
metrics degrade. Post-deploy, the blue target group is left idle for 24 hours as a
rollback target; after 24 hours, blue tasks are stopped to save cost (rollback
beyond 24 hours requires a re-deploy).

We Gain We Lose
Zero user-visible downtime Both blue and green must be backward-
compatible (constraints on migrations
and API)
Self-service deploys (no release Feature teams must understand deploy
engineer) mechanics (training required)
Operational simplicity (no K8s, no Fargate cost premium ~20% over EC2
canary tooling) (~$400/month)
Gradual traffic shift catches production- 30-minute deploy window slower than
only failures rolling (but rolling has slow rollback)
REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
Rolling deploy was rejected because rollback requires a re-deploy of the
previous image (~10 minutes), violating the 5-minute rollback constraint.
Canary was rejected because the canary analysis tooling (Flagger, Istio)
requires operational expertise the team lacks, and the benefit over blue-green's
manual 10/50/100 shift is marginal at our traffic volume. EKS (Kubernetes) was
rejected because the operational burden (control plane, worker nodes, Ingress,
RBAC) is unjustified for a single-container modular monolith; the team's
DevOps capacity cannot sustain production-grade K8s. Lambda was rejected
because the modular monolith topology (long-running JVM, in-process
transactions) is a poor fit for Lambda's 15-minute limit and cold-start
characteristics. The chosen approach (blue-green on ECS Fargate) is the
simplest model that meets the zero-downtime and instant-rollback constraints.
MIGRATION PLAN
The migration from the SSH-and-docker-compose deploy to blue-green on ECS
Fargate was completed in Q4 2025 over 8 weeks. Phase 1 (week 1-2): Terraform
the ECS cluster, ALB, target groups, and RDS — infrastructure as code. Phase 2
(week 3-4): containerise the modular monolith (Dockerfile, ECR repository, task
definition). Phase 3 (week 5-6): blue-green deploy script (GitHub Actions
workflow that runs Flyway, starts green, waits for health, shifts traffic, drains
blue). Phase 4 (week 7-8): parallel run — old deploy and new blue-green both
run on staging, results compared for parity; cutover to blue-green for staging,
then prod. v3.0 adds the 30-minute traffic shift calibration (10% for 5 min, 50%
for 10 min, 100% for 15 min) which was a flat 100% shift in v1.0 — too risky for
subtle failures.
TESTING STRATEGY
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 283

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
Deploy is tested at three levels. (1) Deploy script unit tests: the Terraform and
AWS CLI commands are tested with localstack (AWS emulator) — verifies that
the script produces the expected AWS API calls. (2) Staging deploy: every main-
branch build deploys to staging via the same blue-green script that prod uses —
staging is the canary for the deploy script itself. (3) Production rollback game-
day: weekly, a production deploy is rolled back (target-group swap to blue) to
verify the rollback path works; the rollback is then itself rolled back (swap back
to green). This ensures the rollback muscle is exercised before it is needed in
anger. Health checks: ALB health check on /actuator/health (Spring Boot
Actuator) requires 5 consecutive 200s over 30 seconds before a task is
considered healthy — catches JVM warmup and startup failures.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Deploy is monitored via CloudWatch dashboards per target group. Metrics: (a)
request count per target group (verifies traffic is shifting as expected); (b) error
rate per target group (4xx and 5xx — green error rate should match blue); (c)
latency p50/p99 per target group (green latency should be within 10% of blue);
(d) target health (number of healthy tasks in each target group); (e) connection
drain count (blue tasks draining post-shift). Alarms fire on: green error rate
>1% (halt shift), green latency p99 > 1.5x blue p99 (halt shift), green task
health < desired count (halt shift), deploy duration > 45 minutes (page on-call).
Post-deploy, a 'deploy summary' is posted to Slack with: deploy SHA, duration,
traffic shift timeline, error rate comparison, rollback count (if any).
FUTURE EVOLUTION
Blue-green on ECS Fargate is the right model for PreOne's 5-year horizon. The
trigger for re-evaluation is sustained deploy frequency exceeding daily (which
would make the 30-minute shift window a bottleneck) or traffic exceeding
50,000 RPS (which would make the 10% canary phase too large a blast radius).
The likely evolution is automated canary analysis: a tool like Flagged or a
custom Prometheus query that auto-halts the shift on error-rate anomaly,
eliminating the need for on-call monitoring during deploys. The other likely
evolution is progressive delivery via feature flags (ADR-016) becoming the
primary release mechanism — deploys become routine (just code rollout) and
releases become the tracked event (flag flip). No supersession of this ADR is
expected within 24 months.

DECISION SUMMARY
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  286

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
DECISION
Adopt semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for all PreOne
releases, modules, and APIs. API versioning is URL-based (/api/v1/, /api/v2/)
with one major version supported in parallel for 6 months after deprecation.
Module versions are declared in build.gradle and follow semver. Database
migrations are versioned via Flyway as V<timestamp>__<description>.sql,
forward-only. Release versions are calendar-based quarterly minors
(2026.1, 2026.2, 2026.3) with patches as needed (2026.1.1).
STATUS
Status Accepted
Date Decided 2025-10-15
Decision Owner Chief Architect
Review Cadence Annual or when a major version
supersession occurs
Supersedes None (v1.0 original; v3.0 refreshes
deprecation policy for series
alignment)
CONTEXT
Before v1.0, PreOne had no versioning policy. The API was versioned by
accident — engineers added /v2/ endpoints when they wanted to change a
response shape, but /v1/ was never deprecated, leading to three live versions of
the same endpoint with subtly different behaviour. The mobile app (React
Native) had hardcoded assumptions about /v1/ response shapes that broke
when /v2/ was deployed. Database migrations were numbered V1, V2, V3 with
no consistent naming, and a migration that was reverted left a gap (V4 missing)
that confused Flyway. Release versions were ad-hoc: '2025-q3-hotfix-2',
'august-release-3', 'billing-rewrite' — none sortable, none comparable. The
Office of the Chief Architect identified versioning policy as a Q3 2025 priority
because the lack of policy was creating real customer incidents. A school that
had integrated PreOne's API into their parent portal broke when /v1/ changed
shape without a version bump. The DPDP Act 2023 compliance audit flagged
the absence of a deprecation policy as a finding — regulators expect a
documented sunset process for data-processing APIs that may be used by third
parties. The team evaluated three versioning schemes: pure semver, calendar
versioning (CalVer), and a hybrid (calendar for releases, semver for modules
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 287

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
and APIs). The decision was a hybrid: calendar-based versioning for releases
(because the business communicates in quarters — 'Q3 2025 release'), semver
for modules and APIs (because engineers and API consumers need to reason
about breaking changes). Database migrations use Flyway's timestamp-based
versioning (V<YYYYMMDDHHmmss>__<description>.sql) which is naturally
ordered and avoids numbering conflicts. The policy is enforced through CI
checks (semver validation on module versions, OpenAPI spec version validation
on APIs) and through the ADR workflow (any breaking change requires an
ADR).
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary driver is API consumer trust: schools, parents, and third-party
integrators who build against PreOne's API must be able to plan around version
changes. A documented deprecation policy (6-month notice, 2-release overlap,
sunset announcement) gives consumers the runway to migrate, preventing the
incidents that occurred pre-v1.0. The secondary driver is release
communication: the business needs to tell customers 'this feature ships in the
2026.2 release' — calendar versioning makes this natural. The tertiary driver is
engineering clarity: when an engineer sees module version 2.3.1, they know it's
a patch on the 2.3 minor, which is a minor on the 2 major — semantic meaning
that ad-hoc versions do not convey.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
PreOne has no versioning policy: API versions are unmanaged, database
migrations are inconsistently numbered, and releases have ad-hoc names. This
causes customer incidents, fails compliance audits, and creates engineering
confusion. We need a unified versioning policy covering releases, modules,
APIs, and database migrations.
CONSTRAINTS
● API versioning must be URL-based (not header-based) for browser and
curl compatibility
● At most two major API versions supported in parallel (current +
deprecated)
● Deprecated API version must have a 6-month sunset window
● Database migrations must be forward-only (no rollback migrations —
rollback is via blue-green deploy)
● Release versioning must align with the quarterly business cadence
● Module versioning must support independent versioning per Gradle
subproject
● Version numbers must be machine-parseable (CI validation)

PreOne ADR  -  Volume 1: Architecture Foundation  v3.0
ASSUMPTIONS
● API consumers will migrate within the 6-month deprecation window
(with reminders)
● Quarterly release cadence is stable (no shift to monthly or annual)
● Flyway remains the migration tool (no switch to Liquibase)
● Semantic versioning is understood by the engineering team (training
provided)
● The modular monolith topology holds (single deployable, so module
versions are not user-visible)

DECISION
ADOPTED
We adopt a hybrid versioning policy. (1) Releases: calendar versioning,
quarterly minors (2026.1, 2026.2, 2026.3, 2026.4), patch releases as
needed (2026.1.1, 2026.1.2). (2) Modules: semantic versioning per Gradle
subproject, declared in build.gradle as version = 'MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH'.
(3) APIs: URL-based versioning (/api/v1/, /api/v2/), one major version
supported in parallel for 6 months after deprecation announcement. (4)
Database   migrations:   Flyway   timestamp-based   versioning,
V<YYYYMMDDHHmmss>__<description>.sql, forward-only (no rollback
migrations — rollback is via blue-green deploy to old image, ADR-018).
Deprecation   policy:   6-month   notice   (deprecation   header   on   every
response), 2-release overlap (current + deprecated both supported), sunset
announcement (blog post, email to API consumers, in-product banner).
Breaking changes require an ADR and a major version bump.
DETAILED RATIONALE
The hybrid scheme was chosen because no single scheme fits all artefact types.
Releases are a business communication — 'the 2026.2 release ships in April
2026' — and calendar versioning conveys this directly. Modules are an
engineering artefact — 'enrollment-module 2.3.1' — and semver conveys that
2.3.1 is a patch on 2.3, which is a minor on 2. APIs are a consumer contract —
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  290

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
'/api/v2/' tells the consumer this is a major version that may have breaking
changes — and URL-based semver conveys this in the most discoverable way.
Database migrations are a sequential log — Flyway timestamps convey order
without manual numbering. Calendar versioning for releases aligns with the
quarterly business cadence. The 2026.1 release is the first release of 2026 (Q1),
2026.2 is Q2, etc. Patch releases (2026.1.1) are bugfixes on top of the quarterly
release. This scheme is sortable (2026.2 > 2026.1), comparable (2026.2.1 >
2026.2), and communicates timing (2026.2 is the Q2 2026 release). The
business can plan around it: 'the new billing module ships in 2026.3' is a clear
statement that any stakeholder understands. Semantic versioning for modules
follows the spec: MAJOR version bump for incompatible API changes (e.g.,
removing a public method, changing a method signature), MINOR version
bump for backward-compatible feature additions (e.g., adding a new method,
adding a new optional parameter), PATCH version bump for backward-
compatible bug fixes (e.g., fixing a calculation error). Module versions are
declared in build.gradle and validated by CI: a PR that changes a public API
without a version bump is blocked. The validation uses a tool (japicmp) that
compares the public API of the new version against the previous, classifying
changes as breaking (MAJOR), additive (MINOR), or no-change (PATCH). URL-
based API versioning was chosen over header-based for discoverability and
testability. A consumer can see /api/v2/enrollments in their browser or curl
command and immediately know the version. Header-based versioning
(Accept: application/vnd.preone.v2+json) hides the version in a header that is
easy to forget in tests and impossible to test with a browser. The trade-off is
that URL-based versioning duplicates the endpoint definition (v1 and v2 both
exist), but this is manageable: v2 typically delegates to v1 with a response
transformation, or v1 delegates to v2 with a backward-compatible transform.
The 6-month deprecation window is calibrated to API consumer migration
patterns. Schools that integrate with PreOne's API typically have a 1-3 month
development cycle for changes; 6 months gives them two cycles, which is
enough to plan and execute a migration. The deprecation is signalled three
ways: (a) Deprecation: true header on every response from the deprecated
version; (b) Sunset: <date> header with the specific sunset date; (c) email and
in-product banner to registered API consumers 6 months, 3 months, 1 month,
and 1 week before sunset. After sunset, the deprecated version returns 410
Gone. Flyway timestamp-based migration versioning
(V<YYYYMMDDHHmmss>__<description>.sql) avoids the numbering
conflicts that plagued pre-v1.0 migrations. With sequential numbering (V1, V2,
V3), two engineers creating migrations on the same day would both number
them V4, causing a conflict. With timestamps
(V20260315143001__add_student_middle_name.sql), conflicts are essentially
impossible (would require two engineers to create a migration in the same

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
second). The timestamp also conveys when the migration was created, which is
useful for debugging. Forward-only migrations (no rollback) is a deliberate
choice. Rollback migrations are a known anti-pattern: they cannot undo data
changes (a DELETE that ran cannot be rolled back to restore the deleted rows),
they double the migration surface area (every up has a down), and they create a
false sense of safety (the rollback may not actually restore the previous state).
Instead, rollback is handled at the deployment layer: if a migration breaks
production, the blue-green deploy (ADR-018) swaps back to the previous
image, which works with the new schema (because migrations are backward-
compatible, per ADR-018). The migration itself is not rolled back — it stays
applied — but the code that uses it is rolled back. This is the standard pattern
for SaaS platforms with managed databases.

DATABASE IMPACT
Database migrations use Flyway's timestamp-based versioning:
V<YYYYMMDDHHmmss>__<description>.sql, stored in
src/main/resources/db/migration. Migrations are forward-only — no rollback
migrations. The rationale: rollback migrations cannot undo data changes (a
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 293

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
DELETE that ran cannot restore the rows), and they create a false sense of
safety. Rollback is handled at the deployment layer (ADR-018): if a migration
breaks production, blue-green swaps back to the previous image, which works
with the new schema (because migrations must be backward-compatible,
enforced by code review and the two-phase migration pattern). The two-phase
pattern for breaking changes: deploy 1 adds new column and backfills; deploy 2
switches code to use new column; deploy 3 drops old column. Each deploy is
individually rollback-safe.
API IMPACT
API versioning is URL-based: /api/v1/, /api/v2/. A major version bump (v1 to v2)
is required for breaking changes: removing an endpoint, removing a field,
changing a field type, changing a field's semantics (e.g., 'status' values change).
A minor version bump within a major version (still /api/v1/ but with new
optional fields or new endpoints) does not require a URL change — the major
version URL is stable for backward-compatible additions. The OpenAPI spec is
the source of truth for API versioning: each major version has its own spec file
(openapi-v1.yaml, openapi-v2.yaml). The CI pipeline runs openapi-diff to verify
that changes within a major version are backward-compatible — a breaking
change within /v1/ is a build failure, forcing a new /v2/ spec.
UI IMPACT
The UI calls /api/v1/ (or /v2/) and pins to that version. The UI deploy is
coordinated with the API version: when a new /v2/ is released, the UI is updated
to call /v2/ and deployed after /v2/ is stable. The old /v1/ calls are removed from
the UI in the same deploy that adds /v2/ calls — the UI never calls both versions
simultaneously (that would be confusing). For third-party UI consumers (parent
portal integrations), the 6-month deprecation window applies: they have 6
months to migrate from /v1/ to /v2/ after /v1/ is marked deprecated.
SECURITY IMPACT
Versioning policy improves security by enabling clean deprecation of
vulnerable API versions. If /v1/ has a security flaw that cannot be patched in
place (e.g., a design flaw in the auth flow), /v2/ is released with the fix, /v1/ is
marked deprecated with an accelerated sunset (e.g., 1 month instead of 6), and
consumers are forced to migrate. Without a versioning policy, the vulnerable
/v1/ would have to be patched in place, which may not be possible for design-
level flaws. The trade-off is that supporting two versions doubles the attack
surface during the deprecation window — mitigated by /v1/ being a thin
compatibility shim over /v2/ (not a separate implementation).
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 294

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
Versioning has negligible performance impact. The /api/v1/ and /api/v2/ paths
route to the same controller methods (Spring MVC path matching), with a
version-specific response transformer. The transformer adds ~1ms per
response (field renaming, field filtering) — well within latency budget. Module
versioning has zero runtime impact (versions are build-time metadata).
Database migration versioning (Flyway timestamps) has zero runtime impact
(Flyway runs only at deploy time). The only performance consideration is the
deprecation window: supporting /v1/ and /v2/ simultaneously doubles the API
surface area, but the implementation is shared (not duplicated), so the cost is
the transformer's ~1ms, not a full second implementation.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
Versioning policy scales with the number of supported versions. The policy caps
parallel support at two major versions (current + deprecated), which is
manageable. Each deprecated version is a thin compatibility shim (response
transformer) over the current implementation, so the maintenance cost is
proportional to the API surface area, not to the number of versions. The 6-
month deprecation window ensures that at most one deprecated version exists
at any time (a new major version is released at most every 6 months in practice,
because breaking changes are rare and require ADRs). Module versioning
scales with the number of modules (12 currently, growing to ~20 over 5 years)
— each module has its own version in build.gradle, with no cross-module
version coupling.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Versioning is operated through CI and the ADR workflow. CI validates: module
version bumps match public API changes (japicmp), API spec changes within a
major version are backward-compatible (openapi-diff), Flyway migrations are
sequentially valid (Flyway validate). The ADR workflow gates breaking
changes: a PR that introduces a breaking change must reference an ADR
(accepted or proposed) that justifies the break; without the ADR reference, the
build fails. Deprecation is operated by the API gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway
or a custom filter) which adds Deprecation and Sunset headers to responses
from deprecated versions. The sunset date is tracked in a deprecation registry
(a YAML file in the repo) that CI reads to validate sunset timelines.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
Pure semver was rejected because releases need to communicate timing to
business stakeholders ('Q3 2025 release' is meaningful, 'v4.2.1' is not). Pure
CalVer was rejected because APIs need to convey breaking-change semantics
to consumers (a consumer seeing /api/2026.3/ cannot tell if it has breaking
changes vs /api/2026.2/). Header-based API versioning was rejected because it
is not discoverable (the version is hidden in a header), not testable with curl or
a browser, and interacts poorly with HTTP caching. No-versioning (continuous
deployment) was rejected because PreOne has API consumers (schools,
parents, third-party integrators) who need version stability; without versioning,
breaking changes are unannounced and cause incidents. The hybrid scheme is
slightly more complex than a single scheme, but each artefact type uses the
scheme best suited to its consumers.
MIGRATION PLAN
PreOne ADR Series  -  Phase 2 / 10  -  Vol 1: Architecture Foundation  -  297

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
The migration to the hybrid versioning policy was completed in Q4 2025 over 4
weeks. Phase 1 (week 1): adopt CalVer for releases — the next release was
branded 2025.4 (Q4 2025); previous ad-hoc names were retired. Phase 2 (week
2): adopt semver for modules — each Gradle subproject's build.gradle was
updated with a version field starting at 1.0.0; japicmp was added to CI. Phase 3
(week 3): adopt URL-based API versioning — existing /v1/ endpoints were
frozen (no breaking changes allowed); future breaking changes require /v2/.
Phase 4 (week 4): adopt Flyway timestamp versioning — existing V1..V47
migrations were renamed to V<original-date>__<description>.sql; Flyway's
repair command was run to update checksums. v3.0 adds the formal
deprecation registry (YAML file) and the automated reminder emails.
TESTING STRATEGY
Versioning is tested at three levels. (1) CI validation: japicmp compares module
public APIs against the previous version, classifying changes as
breaking/additive/patch; the build fails if the version bump does not match the
change classification. openapi-diff compares API spec files, failing on breaking
changes within a major version. Flyway validate verifies migration checksums
match the schema history table. (2) Contract tests (ADR-149): Pact consumer
tests verify that consumers can call /v1/ and /v2/ and get expected responses;
provider tests verify that the API honours pacts for both versions. (3)
Deprecation tests: a test verifies that deprecated /v1/ responses include
Deprecation and Sunset headers with correct values; a test verifies that
sunset /v1/ returns 410 Gone. Coverage target: 100% of public API changes
have a version-bump verification.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
Versioning is monitored via the API gateway, which logs the version of every
request (/v1/ vs /v2/). Metrics: (a) request rate per API version (target: /v1/
request rate trends to 0 as sunset approaches); (b) consumer count per API
version (target: <5 consumers on deprecated version at sunset); (c)
deprecation header emission rate (target: 100% of deprecated-version
responses include headers); (d) sunset 410 response rate (target: 0 before
sunset date, 100% after). Alerts fire on: deprecated version request rate not
declining (consumers not migrating), deprecated version error rate > current
version (compatibility shim bug), sunset date approaching with >5 active
consumers (migration at risk). Weekly report to engineering leadership on API
version health.
FUTURE EVOLUTION
The hybrid versioning policy is stable; no supersession expected within 5 years.
The likely evolution is tooling: an automated migration assistant that helps API
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 298

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
consumers migrate from /v1/ to /v2/ (e.g., a tool that diffs the two specs and
generates a migration guide). Another likely evolution is finer-grained API
versioning (e.g., /api/v2.1/ for minor additions within v2) if the major-version
granularity proves too coarse — but this is not currently needed and would be a
v2.0 of this ADR. The 6-month deprecation window may shorten to 3 months if
consumers migrate faster than expected; this would be a minor policy
adjustment, not a supersession. The forward-only migration policy is unlikely to
change — it is the industry standard for SaaS platforms.

DECISION SUMMARY
DECISION
Lock the PreOne technology stack for 12 months (until 2027-Q3). Locked
choices: Java 21 LTS, Spring Boot 3.2.x, PostgreSQL 16.x, Redis 7.x, React
18.x, TypeScript 5.x, Node 20 LTS (builds), AWS (ap-south-1 Mumbai), ECS
Fargate, ALB, RDS, ElastiCache, S3, SES, SNS, CloudWatch, GitHub
Actions, Terraform. Minor version upgrades allowed; major version
upgrades require a superseding ADR. New technology adoption requires
ADR and ARB approval. Rationale: stability over novelty, familiarity over
best-of-breed, simplicity over optimisation.

CONTEXT
Before v1.0, PreOne's technology stack was a graveyard of 'best-of-breed'
choices that individual engineers had advocated for and then abandoned. The
codebase had: Java 17 (with some modules on 21 because an engineer wanted
records), PostgreSQL 14 (with one team experimenting with 16 beta), Redis 6
(because the DevOps engineer was wary of 7's breaking changes), a React 17

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
frontend with parts migrated to 18, three different logging frameworks (SLF4J,
Log4j2, Logback) because each team had a preference, two CI tools (Jenkins
and GitHub Actions) because the migration was never completed, and four
different HTTP clients (OkHttp, Apache HttpClient, Spring WebClient, Java 11
HttpClient) because engineers used whatever they knew. The cost of this
fragmentation was severe. Security patches required touching four HTTP
clients instead of one. Onboarding required learning three logging frameworks.
Builds were slow because each Gradle subproject could pin different
dependency versions. Bug fixes had to be backported to multiple versions of the
same library. The DPDP Act 2023 compliance audit flagged the stack
fragmentation as a finding: regulators expect a documented, controlled
technology stack with clear ownership and patching cadence. The Office of the
Chief Architect proposed a 12-month technology stack freeze. The freeze is not
'never change anything' — it is 'change only via ADR, with ARB approval, and
only when the change is justified by a concrete need, not by novelty or
preference'. The freeze covers: programming languages, frameworks,
databases, cloud services, CI/CD tools, IaC tools, and observability tools. The
freeze does not cover: application libraries within a framework (e.g., adding a
new Spring Boot starter is allowed without ADR if it does not introduce a new
framework). The 12-month duration is calibrated to give the team stability to
ship features without constant tool churn, while being short enough that the
stack does not become obsolete (a 24-month freeze would risk falling behind on
security patches and language features).
BUSINESS DRIVERS
The primary driver is engineering velocity: a frozen stack means engineers
solve business problems, not tooling problems. No time spent evaluating
'should we use Vue or React?' — the answer is React, end of debate. No time
spent onboarding to a new framework because a teammate introduced it — the
team's expertise compounds on the frozen stack. The secondary driver is
security and compliance: a frozen stack has a clear patching cadence (Java
quarterly CPU, Spring Boot monthly, PostgreSQL minor releases) and a clear
owner (DevOps for infra, Foundation Tech Lead for languages and
frameworks). The DPDP Act audit finding is resolved by the documented freeze.
The tertiary driver is operational simplicity: one set of runbooks, one set of
monitoring dashboards, one set of on-call procedures — not a different set per
technology.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
PreOne's technology stack is fragmented across multiple versions of languages,
frameworks, databases, and tools, causing engineering velocity loss, security
patching burden, compliance audit findings, and operational complexity. We
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 302

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
need a frozen, documented, controlled technology stack with a clear upgrade
policy.
CONSTRAINTS
● Stack must be supported for 12 months (until 2027-Q3) without forced
upgrades
● Major version upgrades require a superseding ADR (e.g., PostgreSQL
16 to 17)
● New technology adoption requires an ADR and ARB approval
● All choices must be available in AWS ap-south-1 (Mumbai) region for
data residency
● All choices must have LTS (long-term support) versions, not bleeding-
edge
● Stack must be operable by a 2-engineer DevOps team (no exotic
tooling)
● Stack must comply with P5 Simplicity (ADR-001) — minimise distinct
technologies
ASSUMPTIONS
● AWS ap-south-1 will continue to support all chosen services for 12
months
● LTS versions of chosen technologies will receive security patches for 12
months
● The engineering team's expertise in the chosen stack will remain (no
mass attrition)
● No business requirement will emerge that the frozen stack cannot meet
(if so, superseding ADR)
● Open-source dependencies remain available (no critical library is
abandoned)
● AWS pricing remains stable (no 2x price increase that would force a
change)

DECISION
ADOPTED
We freeze the PreOne technology stack for 12 months (until 2027-Q3) with
the following locked choices. Languages and runtimes: Java 21 (LTS,
backend), TypeScript 5.x (frontend), Node 20 LTS (builds only).
Frameworks: Spring Boot 3.2.x (backend), React 18.x (frontend). Data
stores: PostgreSQL 16.x (primary, via RDS), Redis 7.x (cache, via
ElastiCache). Cloud: AWS, region ap-south-1 (Mumbai). Compute: ECS
Fargate (container orchestration). Networking: ALB (load balancer), Route
53 (DNS), CloudFront (CDN). Storage: S3 (object storage), ECR (container
images). Messaging: SES (email), SNS (push notifications). Observability:
CloudWatch (infra metrics, logs), Prometheus (app metrics), Grafana
(dashboards), OpenTelemetry (traces). CI/CD: GitHub Actions. IaC:
Terraform. Upgrade policy: minor versions allowed (e.g., PostgreSQL 16.1
to 16.4) without ADR; major versions (e.g., PostgreSQL 16 to 17) require a
superseding ADR. New technology adoption requires an ADR and ARB
approval. Rationale: stability over novelty; team familiarity over best-of-
breed; operational simplicity over optimisation.
DETAILED RATIONALE
The 12-month freeze was chosen as the balance between stability and
flexibility. A shorter freeze (6 months) would not give the team enough stability
to compound expertise — engineers would spend too much time evaluating
upgrades. A longer freeze (24 months) risks falling behind on security patches
(LTS versions have 18-month support cycles for some technologies) and
language features (Java releases every 6 months; a 24-month freeze would skip
4 releases). 12 months gives the team 4 Java releases worth of stability (they
adopt the LTS, skip the non-LTS) and aligns with the annual review cadence.
Java 21 LTS was chosen as the backend language because: (a) it is the current
LTS (released September 2023, supported until September 2028 for LTS
patches); (b) it introduces records, sealed classes, and pattern matching, which
simplify DDD tactical patterns (value objects as records, sealed aggregates); (c)
the team has deep Java expertise (90% of engineers are Java-primary); (d)
Spring Boot 3.x requires Java 17+, so 21 is the natural choice. Java 25 (next
LTS, September 2025) was considered but rejected because the team has not
yet validated Spring Boot compatibility, and the freeze is about stability, not
chasing the latest LTS. Spring Boot 3.2.x was chosen because: (a) it is the
current stable version with Java 21 support; (b) it provides native compilation
(GraalVM) which we may use for startup-time-sensitive services; (c) it has first-
class observability (Micrometer, OpenTelemetry) which aligns with P4
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 305

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
(Observability); (d) the team's expertise is deep (every engineer has shipped
Spring Boot in production). Alternatives considered: Quarkus (rejected — team
has no expertise, marginal performance benefit at our scale), Micronaut
(rejected — same), Helidon (rejected — too niche). Spring Boot is not the 'best'
framework in absolute terms — it is the best fit for our constraints (team
expertise, ecosystem, stability). PostgreSQL 16.x was chosen as the primary
database because: (a) it is the current stable version (released September
2023, supported for 5 years); (b) it has improved performance for parallel
queries and logical replication; (c) RDS supports it with automated backups and
multi-AZ; (d) the team has deep PostgreSQL expertise. Alternatives considered:
MySQL (rejected — weaker concurrency, less feature-rich), MongoDB (rejected
— PreOne's data is relational, not document-oriented), DynamoDB (rejected —
would require complete data model redesign, vendor lock-in). PostgreSQL is
the relational database of choice for SaaS platforms. Redis 7.x was chosen as
the cache because: (a) it is the current stable version with improved ACLs and
function support; (b) ElastiCache supports it with managed failover; (c) the
team uses it for session storage, rate limiting, and feature flag caching.
Alternatives considered: Memcached (rejected — no persistence, no advanced
data structures), Hazelcast (rejected — overkill for our cache use case), in-
process cache (rejected — does not work across replicas). React 18.x was
chosen as the frontend framework because: (a) it is the current stable version
with concurrent rendering and server components; (b) the team has deep React
expertise; (c) the ecosystem (Next.js, React Router, React Query) is mature; (d)
TypeScript 5.x support is first-class. Alternatives considered: Vue 3 (rejected —
smaller ecosystem, less team expertise), Angular (rejected — heavier, more
opinionated, less team expertise), Svelte (rejected — too niche, smaller hiring
pool). React is not the 'best' frontend framework — it is the best fit for our
constraints. AWS was chosen as the cloud provider because: (a) the team has
deep AWS expertise; (b) ap-south-1 (Mumbai) region provides data residency
for India (DPDP Act compliance); (c) the service catalog (RDS, ElastiCache,
ECS, ALB, S3, SES, SNS, CloudWatch) covers all our needs; (d) the pricing is
competitive at our scale. Alternatives considered: Azure (rejected — smaller
team expertise, weaker India region), GCP (rejected — smaller team expertise,
weaker India region presence at the time of decision), on-premise (rejected —
capital expense, operational burden). ECS Fargate was chosen over EKS
(Kubernetes) because: (a) Fargate is serverless — no EC2 instances to patch, no
K8s control plane to operate; (b) the team's DevOps capacity (2 engineers)
cannot sustain production-grade K8s; (c) the modular monolith is a single
container, not a complex multi-service topology that would benefit from K8s.
The cost premium (~20% over EC2) is justified by the operational saving. EKS
would be reconsidered if PreOne extracts modules into separate services
(ADR-002 future evolution), at which point K8s' service mesh and orchestration
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 306

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
would justify the operational cost. GitHub Actions was chosen as CI/CD per
ADR-017. Terraform was chosen as IaC because: (a) it is the industry standard
for AWS IaC; (b) the team has Terraform expertise; (c) the AWS provider is
mature; (d) it supports drift detection and state management. Alternatives
considered: CloudFormation (rejected — less expressive, AWS-only), Pulumi
(rejected — team has no expertise, marginal benefit), CDK (rejected — same).
The upgrade policy (minor versions allowed, major versions require ADR)
balances stability with security. Minor versions (e.g., PostgreSQL 16.1 to 16.4)
are backward-compatible and include security patches — adopting them
without ADR overhead keeps the stack secure. Major versions (e.g.,
PostgreSQL 16 to 17) may include breaking changes and require careful testing
— the ADR process ensures due diligence. New technology adoption (e.g.,
adding Kafka for event streaming) requires an ADR that justifies the addition,
documents the operational impact, and is approved by the ARB.

DATABASE IMPACT
PostgreSQL 16.x is the locked database version, accessed via RDS (managed
PostgreSQL). Minor version upgrades (16.1 to 16.4) are applied automatically
by RDS during the maintenance window, without ADR — these are backward-
compatible and include security patches. Major version upgrades (16 to 17)
require a superseding ADR that documents: the new features required, the
migration plan (RDS major version upgrade is a multi-step process with
potential downtime), the rollback plan, and the testing strategy. The freeze
ensures the database layer is stable: application code can assume PostgreSQL
16 features (e.g., SQL/JSON path expressions, improved parallel queries)
without conditional logic for older versions.
API IMPACT
The frozen stack influences the API implementation: Spring Boot 3.2.x provides
the REST framework (Spring MVC), the OpenAPI spec generator (springdoc-
openapi), and the contract testing framework (Spring Cloud Contract). API
consumers are not directly affected by the stack freeze — the API is a contract,
not an implementation. However, the freeze ensures the API implementation is
stable: a Spring Boot 3.2 to 3.3 minor upgrade is allowed without ADR
(backward-compatible), but a Spring Boot 3 to 4 major upgrade would require a
superseding ADR and could affect API behaviour (e.g., default serialisation
changes). The freeze protects API consumers from implementation churn.
UI IMPACT
React 18.x and TypeScript 5.x are the locked frontend stack. Minor version
upgrades (React 18.2 to 18.3, TypeScript 5.4 to 5.5) are allowed without ADR —
these are backward-compatible. Major upgrades (React 18 to 19, TypeScript 5
to 6) require a superseding ADR. The freeze ensures the frontend toolchain
(Vite, ESLint, Jest, React Testing Library) is stable — engineers do not need to
relearn the toolchain every quarter. The UI build process (Node 20 LTS, npm) is
also frozen, ensuring reproducible builds (ADR-017).
SECURITY IMPACT
The stack freeze improves security by enabling a clear patching cadence. Java
21 LTS receives quarterly Critical Patch Updates (CPU) from Oracle (and free
updates from OpenJDK distributions like Amazon Corretto, which we use).
Spring Boot 3.2.x receives monthly patch releases. PostgreSQL 16.x receives
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 309

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
quarterly minor releases. Redis 7.x receives periodic patch releases. The
DevOps team applies these patches within 30 days of release (15 days for
critical CVEs) without ADR — they are minor version upgrades, allowed by the
freeze policy. The freeze does not block security patches; it blocks
unsanctioned technology changes. The DPDP Act compliance audit finding
('undocumented technology stack') is resolved by this ADR.
PERFORMANCE IMPACT
The frozen stack has known performance characteristics, benchmarked at v1.0:
Spring Boot 3.2 on Java 21 sustains ~15,000 RPS per replica (I/O-bound),
PostgreSQL 16 handles ~50,000 writes/second on a db.r6g.large instance,
Redis 7 handles ~100,000 ops/second on a cache.m6g.large. These numbers
are stable because the stack is frozen — performance regressions are caught in
CI (Lighthouse for frontend, JMeter for backend) and attributed to application
code, not to stack upgrades. A non-frozen stack would have confounding
variables (did latency regress because of our code or because of a Spring Boot
upgrade?). The freeze eliminates this ambiguity.
SCALABILITY ANALYSIS
The frozen stack scales horizontally within AWS. ECS Fargate task count scales
via auto-scaling policies (CPU/memory based). RDS PostgreSQL scales via read
replicas (up to 15) and vertical instance sizing (up to db.r6g.24xlarge).
ElastiCache Redis scales via cluster mode (sharding) and read replicas. S3 and
CloudFront scale automatically. The ceiling is the modular monolith's single-
write-primary database: at ~50,000 writes/second (PostgreSQL 16 on a large
instance), PreOne will not approach this in the 5-year horizon. If the ceiling is
reached, the path is module extraction (ADR-002 future evolution), not a stack
change — the same stack scales to distributed deployments. The freeze does
not constrain scaling; it constrains technology churn.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
The frozen stack is operated by a 2-engineer DevOps team. Each technology in
the stack has a documented runbook (onboarding, scaling, backup, restore,
incident response). The team's expertise compounds: an engineer who
debugged a PostgreSQL 16 issue last quarter can apply that knowledge this
quarter (because the version is unchanged). With a non-frozen stack,
knowledge depreciates as versions change. Patching is the primary operational
cadence: monthly patch review (which minor versions are available, which
CVEs are addressed), quarterly patch application (apply during maintenance
window), annual major-version review (are any major upgrades warranted?).
The freeze makes this cadence predictable.

REJECTED ALTERNATIVES
No freeze (the pre-v1.0 state) was rejected because the fragmentation cost was
severe: security patching burden, onboarding cost, compliance audit failure,
operational complexity. 24-month freeze was rejected because LTS versions for
some technologies (Redis 7) have shorter support cycles, risking EOL within
the freeze window. Rolling freeze (quarterly review) was rejected because it
does not meet the 'stability' bar — quarterly reviews would lead to quarterly
debates about whether to upgrade, consuming engineering time. Best-of-breed
was rejected because it directly contradicts P5 (Simplicity) and P9 (Automate)
— each new tool multiplies the operational and automation burden. The 12-
month freeze with ADR-gated changes is the right balance: long enough to

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
compound expertise, short enough to avoid obsolescence, with a clear path
(ADR) for justified changes.
MIGRATION PLAN
The migration to the frozen stack was completed in Q4 2025 over 10 weeks.
Phase 1 (week 1-2): upgrade Java from 17 (some modules) to 21 (all modules) —
required updating Gradle config and fixing a few reflection issues with records.
Phase 2 (week 3-4): upgrade PostgreSQL from 14 to 16 — RDS major version
upgrade with downtime during maintenance window; Flyway migrations re-
validated. Phase 3 (week 5-6): upgrade Redis from 6 to 7 — ElastiCache engine
upgrade with blue-green cache migration. Phase 4 (week 7-8): consolidate
HTTP clients to Spring WebClient (removed OkHttp, Apache HttpClient, Java
11 HttpClient). Phase 5 (week 9-10): consolidate logging to SLF4J + Logback
(removed Log4j2 direct usage). v3.0 adds the formal upgrade policy (minor
versions allowed, major versions require ADR) which was implicit in v1.0.
TESTING STRATEGY
The frozen stack is tested via CI gatekeeping. A PR that introduces a new
technology (e.g., a new Maven dependency that is not in the approved list) is
blocked by a CI check (Gradle dependency analysis against an allowlist). A PR
that upgrades a major version (e.g., Spring Boot 3.2 to 3.3 — but 3.3 is not yet in
the freeze) is blocked until a superseding ADR is referenced. Minor version
upgrades (e.g., Spring Boot 3.2.0 to 3.2.1) pass through. The allowlist is
maintained in a YAML file in the repo, and changes to the allowlist require a PR
(which itself triggers ARB review). Compatibility tests: every minor version
upgrade runs the full test suite (unit, integration, contract, ArchUnit) to verify
backward compatibility. Performance tests: quarterly benchmarking of the
frozen stack to detect performance drift.
MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
The frozen stack is monitored for security and currency. Security: weekly scan
of all dependencies (Trivy, Snyk) for CVEs; critical CVEs trigger an emergency
patch within 24 hours. Currency: quarterly review of LTS support dates for
each technology (Java 21 EOL, PostgreSQL 16 EOL, Redis 7 EOL); if any EOL is
within 12 months, trigger a superseding ADR for the upgrade. Adoption: track
which technologies in the freeze are actually used (e.g., if SES is in the freeze
but never used, it can be removed from the freeze in the next review). Stack
health dashboard in Grafana shows: per-technology version, days since last
patch, days to EOL, CVE count, and usage metrics. Alerts fire on: CVE with
CVSS > 7 on a frozen technology, EOL within 12 months, unused technology in
freeze (cleanup candidate).
FUTURE EVOLUTION
PreOne ADR Series - Phase 2 / 10 - Vol 1: Architecture Foundation - 313

PreOne ADR - Volume 1: Architecture Foundation v3.0
The technology stack freeze is reviewed annually (next review: 2026-10). The
likely evolution at the 2027-Q3 expiry is a v2.0 of this ADR that re-freezes for
another 12 months, with possibly one or two major version upgrades justified
by superseding ADRs during the freeze window. The most likely upgrade
candidates are: Java 21 to 25 (next LTS, September 2025 — but only if Spring
Boot 3.x supports it well by 2027), PostgreSQL 16 to 17 (if 17 offers significant
features we need), React 18 to 19 (if 19 stabilises and offers features we need).
New technology adoption candidates (each would require an ADR): Kafka for
event streaming (if we extract modules into separate services), Elasticsearch
for full-text search (if PostgreSQL's full-text search proves insufficient), a
service mesh like Istio (if we move to EKS for multi-service topology). None of
these are planned for the freeze window; they are candidates for the post-2027-
Q3 review.
