Task: Read PreOne docs + setup PostgreSQL for fullstack webapp

Work Log:
- Extracted PREONE_DOC zip (19 docs, ~5.7MB markdown) from /home/z/my-project/upload
- Launched 5 parallel Explore agents: design system HTML, PRD/BRC/Vision, Prisma Schema v3.0 + ERD v3.0, API contracts + backend TD, frontend architecture + UI philosophy + DDD
- Key findings: PreOne = Enterprise Preschool OS (SaaS ERP); multi-tenant (Tenant→Branch→Classroom→Student); 8 roles; money in integer paise; soft delete; /api/v1 envelope {success,data,meta,traceId}; Design System v4.1 "Windows Shell Edition" (no sidebar; 72px header + 64px bottom taskbar + Start button/logo navigation; Poppins+Nunito; primary #7C3AED; light + Deep Space dark)
- No sudo in sandbox → installed @embedded-postgres/linux-x64@17.10.0-beta.17 (PostgreSQL 17.10 user-space binaries)
- Ran hydrate-symlinks postinstall manually (ICU lib fix)
- scripts/pg-setup.sh + scripts/pg-admin.mjs: initdb at db/pgdata, port 54329, role+db `preone` created

Stage Summary:
- PostgreSQL 17.10 running: postgresql://preone:preone@127.0.0.1:54329/preone
- All design tokens + schema knowledge captured in conversation; ready for Prisma schema + app build

Task: Apply uploaded real PreOne logo (preone_logo.png) everywhere in the app

Work Log:
- Inspected upload/preone_logo.png: 1760x894 RGBA, true transparency; wordmark with planet-O, ring, star, green/pink balls
- Asset pipeline (scripts/logo-analyze.py, logo-final.py, logo-final2.py):
  - public/preone-logo.png: trimmed + resized 1000w full wordmark
  - public/preone-mark.png: 512px square mark = planet disc (r274 @ 1038,550) + rotated-ellipse ring band, star/balls dropped via connected components, "n" letter surgically carved (x>=1292, y 440-725), gaussian-feathered mask
  - src/app/icon.png (128) + src/app/apple-icon.png (180) via Next file conventions (favicon auto-served)
- Code changes:
  - PLogo.tsx: PLogoMark + PLogoWordmark now render real PNG assets (was placeholder SVG)
  - AppShell.tsx: header = wordmark only (no duplicate mark); taskbar Start = planet mark 36px
  - page.tsx: login brand = wordmark + "Preschool Operating System" caption; card head = planet mark 52
  - OnboardClient.tsx: header = wordmark + "Platform Console"
  - globals.css: .wm-img sizing (header 30px, login 56px), removed gradient-text b rules
  - Deleted stale public/logo.svg
- Verified via agent-browser screenshots (download/shot-*-newlogo.png): login light, dashboard light, dashboard dark, start menu, taskbar mark, RBAC redirect (parent cannot access /onboard)
- Debugged: turbopack stale CSS chunk -> restart; sandbox kills background servers after failed calls -> use prod build (bun run start) which is light and stable

Stage Summary:
- Real PreOne logo live across: header, taskbar start, login (2 spots), onboard console, favicon/apple-icon
- Production server running on :3000 (bun run start); build passed clean

Task: "ab kya bachaa hai" — final QA pass, find and fix remaining bugs

Work Log:
- Verified server (prod build :3000) + embedded PostgreSQL 17.10 (port 54329) running
- Smoke-tested all 15 API endpoints: found dashboard 500 + tenants 500
- Bug 1 (dashboard): Prisma select written as array ['totalCents',...] → must be object {totalCents:true,...}. Fixed in src/app/api/v1/dashboard/route.ts
- Bug 2 (tenants): _count.select used relation 'users' but schema relation is 'members'. Fixed in src/app/api/v1/tenants/route.ts
- Bug 3 (onboarding blocker): platform@preone.in (no TenantUser membership) got 403 at login → client-onboarding console unusable. Login route now signs PLATFORM_ADMIN session (tenantId:null) for membership-less users
- Rebuilt + restarted via pkill standalone/server.js (note: pkill "next start" doesn't match bun standalone proc)
- Final matrix: all 14 APIs 200 (attendance 400 = requires classroomId, correct); 10 /app pages 200 for owner; /onboard 200 for platform admin; RBAC redirects verified both ways

Stage Summary:
- Zero known bugs remaining; full QA matrix green
- Demo logins: platform@preone.in / owner@sunshine.demo etc, password Preone@123

Task: Short product flow + usage guide PDF for PreOne

Work Log:
- Routed to Creative Flow brief (guide/handbook); read SKILL.md, creative-flow.md, fonts.md, overflow.md, palette.md, typography.md, pagination.md
- Built download/preone-product-guide.html (720x1020, Poppins+Nunito self-hosted woff2 in assets/fonts, violet #7C3AED family, real PreOne logo on cover + closing)
- Content: cover / What is PreOne / Login & Roles (7 demo creds table) / 3-stage Complete Flow (Client Onboarding -> School Setup -> Daily Operations) / 10-module quick reference / 5 Pro Tips / closing band
- Fixes during QA: cover orbs moved to background radial-gradients (overflow risk + cover_validate false positives); Nunito self-hosted (CDN timing); em-dash nbsp binding; body bg light (dark voids under un-splittable cards); spacing compressed to close orphan 6th page; author metadata via pdf.py meta.set
- Final: 5 pages, 650 KB, pdf_qa 11/11 PASS, 0 text corruption, fonts embedded

Stage Summary:
- Delivered download/preone-product-guide.pdf + .html + assets/ (self-contained editable source)

Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Restart app server + PostgreSQL after session restart

Work Log:
- Found both PostgreSQL (:54329) and app (:3000) down after environment restart
- Fixed 4 issues blocking PG startup:
  1. Stale postmaster.pid -> removed
  2. ICU lib symlinks missing (libicu*.so.60) -> recreated -> libicu*.so.60.2
  3. pgdata dir permission 0755 -> chmod 700
  4. initdb runtime dirs deleted (pg_notify, pg_tblspc, pg_logical/snapshots, pg_multixact/*, pg_wal/archive_status, pg_snapshots, pg_serial, pg_stat, pg_stat_tmp) -> recreated empty; WAL redo recovered data cleanly
- Fixed .env: had been overwritten to SQLite (file:...custom.db) -> restored postgresql://preone:preone@127.0.0.1:54329/preone
- prisma generate + bun run build (clean) + server start
- KEY LESSON: sandbox kills plain `nohup &` and `setsid &` background procs between tool calls; `setsid --fork <cmd>` survives (verified across calls). pg_ctl daemonized postgres also survives.

Stage Summary:
- PostgreSQL 17.10 :54329 + Next.js standalone :3000 both running and stable
- Smoke matrix: / 200, login (platform+owner) 200, dashboard/students/leads/invoices/announcements 200, attendance 400-no-classroomId (by design), /app/dashboard 200, /onboard 200, tenants api 200
- Demo accounts intact: platform@preone.in, owner@/principal@/teacher@/accounts@/parent@sunshine.demo (Preone@123)

Task ID: 6
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Complete flow audit of PreOne docs -> canonical product flow document (32 sections, DOCX)

Work Log:
- Loaded docx skill chain: SKILL.md -> routes/create.md -> references/docx-js-core.md, common-rules.md, toc.md, design-system.md (R1 recipe, DM-1 palette, calcTitleLayout/calcCoverSpacing) -> scenes/report.md
- Launched 5 parallel Explore agents over all 19 source MDs (~111K lines); returned full conflict evidence with quotes: 6 role taxonomies, 4+ admission pipelines, 2 data-model generations (school_id/_cents vs tenantId/Decimal), 3 stacks (Spring vs NestJS vs Next-API), 34-entry conflict register, Growth Passport=UNDEFINED in sources
- Wrote modular generation scripts in scripts/preone-doc/: helpers.js (DM-1 palette, tbl/note/flow builders), content-part1..7.js (32 sections), generate.js (R1 cover + 3-section architecture: cover / TOC roman / body arabic)
- Fixed bug: arrays pushed without spread -> fixed via body.flat(Infinity)
- Pipeline: node generate.js -> add_toc_placeholders.py --auto (107 headings, exit 0) -> postprocess.py (footer PAGE \* ROMAN / \* arabic patches, removed empty pgNumType) -> postcheck.py (0 errors, 2 allowed warnings)
- Visual QA via LibreOffice->PDF->PNG: cover, TOC, body, conflict-register table, hierarchy flow, RBAC 12-col matrix, clean ending - all correct (81 pages, 76 body pages)

Stage Summary:
- Deliverables: /home/z/my-project/download/PreOne_Canonical_Product_Flow_Audit_v1.0.docx (editable master) + same-name .pdf
- Content: 32 sections per brief - conflict register C01-C34, canonical 11 roles (D3), tenant hierarchy (D2), auth Option B, tenant lifecycle DRAFT->PENDING_ACTIVATION->ONBOARDING->ACTIVE->SUSPENDED->ARCHIVED, 5 separated admission status domains, student lifecycle, attendance 5-status + correction model, paise/GST-0%/BRC-slab rulings, Growth Passport RECOMMENDED composition, AI never-write layer, 13 state machines, canonical envelope, 29 edge cases, 29 E2E flows, master flow, 11 open decisions, per-team readiness checklists

Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: "start the server" — restart PostgreSQL + Next.js after session restart

Work Log:
- Both services down (no postgres process, .next empty)
- PG startup fixes (same class as Task 5): removed stale postmaster.pid; chmod 700 pgdata; recreated ICU symlinks (libicu*.so.60 -> .60.2); recreated ALL runtime dirs — this time also pg_twophase, pg_commit_ts, pg_dynshmem, pg_replslot (log FATAL pointed to pg_twophase)
- .env had again been overwritten to SQLite (file:...custom.db) -> restored postgresql://preone:preone@127.0.0.1:54329/preone
- NEW finding: sandbox shell exports DATABASE_URL=file:...custom.db as an env var, which OVERRIDES .env for all child processes -> must export correct DATABASE_URL explicitly for prisma generate/build/server start
- prisma generate + bun run build + setsid --fork bun .next/standalone/server.js (survives between calls)
- Smoke matrix 29/30 -> found REAL BUG: /api/v1/tenants returned full tenant list to school OWNER (200). Root cause: OWNER: ['*'] wildcard matched platform:manage in can(). Owner could read ALL tenants + POST new tenants (cross-tenant leak / priv-esc)
- Fix in src/lib/auth.ts can(): '*' now grants all school-scope permissions but never platform:* (tenant plane != school plane). Rebuilt + restarted
- Final: smoke 30/30 PASS; unit check: OWNER keeps students/finance/settings write, loses platform:manage; PLATFORM_ADMIN keeps platform:manage; TEACHER unchanged
- Data intact: 1 tenant, 24 students, 9 users, 24 invoices

Stage Summary:
- PostgreSQL 17.10 :54329 + PreOne prod :3000 running stable
- RBAC hardened: platform:* permissions now exclusive to PLATFORM_ADMIN
- Scripts saved: scripts/db-check.mjs, scripts/smoke.sh (reusable startup QA)
- Demo accounts unchanged: platform@preone.in / owner@|principal@|teacher@|accounts@|parent@sunshine.demo (Preone@123)

Task ID: 8
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: M00 — Preschool Creation & Setup (new foundational domain, brief with 42 sections)

Work Log:
- Impact map FIRST (per brief): docs/M00_Implementation_Impact_Map.md — entity mapping (no redesign: AcademicSession=AY, Classroom=class/section unit, ProgramType enum kept + new Program master), new entities, 21-step registry, API/UI/security impact, acceptance criteria
- Schema (additive): +9 enums, +8 models (SchoolSetup, SchoolSetupStep, SchoolSetupValidationRun, Program, Facility, StaffProfile, CalendarEvent, SchoolConfig), +Classroom.programId/facilityId, +Branch.capacity; prisma db push on PG 54329
- Engine src/lib/setup/: steps.ts (21 steps, MANDATORY/OPTIONAL/RECOMMENDED, dependency graph, 4 phases), engine.ts (predicates derive completion from REAL data — lazy init for pre-M00 tenants, auto-complete with system attribution, drift → changedAfterCompletion, tenant state machine NOT_STARTED→IN_PROGRESS/BLOCKED→READY_FOR_REVIEW→READY_FOR_GO_LIVE→LIVE), validate.ts (15 categories PASS/WARNING/BLOCKED, persisted runs, go-live = all mandatory steps done + no BLOCKED categories)
- APIs (existing envelope+RBAC settings:read/write+audit): setup/status|progress|dependencies|validate|go-live, setup/steps/[key] {complete|skip|reopen}, setup/config/[domain] (10 JSON domains), setup/school-profile, setup/import/students (CSV preview→commit, no silent dupes); NEW CRUD: branches, programs, facilities, academic-years, calendar, staff (link|new modes, created≠assigned); classrooms POST/PATCH extended (programId, primaryTeacherId, facilityId, capacity over-allocation guard); tenants POST wizard extended in-transaction: Program rows + SchoolSetup + 21 SchoolSetupStep rows
- UI (existing design system only): nav Setup entry (rocket, g-violet); /app/setup dashboard (progress, 4 phase groups, status/blockers/last-updated/completed-by per step, guidance feed, View Dependencies modal, validation tab 15 category cards, summary tab, go-live confirm); /app/setup/[step] guided pages (config forms driven by step-forms.ts schemas with defaults, CRUD tables+modals, dependency "Why is this blocked?" banner with Fix Configuration links, Skip optional, Save as Draft/Save & Continue with actor attribution); first-login: /app/dashboard server-side redirects OWNER/PRINCIPAL to /app/setup while not LIVE; Settings entry card
- E2E (scripts/m00-e2e.sh): brand-new tenant via /onboard → engine auto-completed 7 wizard-covered steps → 12 config/CRUD steps → 2 optional skips → READY_FOR_REVIEW 100% → validation WARNING (no blockers) → READY_FOR_GO_LIVE → GO-LIVE → LIVE; teacher role 403 on setup mutations. 41/41 PASS
- Bugs found & fixed during E2E/browser QA: go-live lacked mandatory-step gate (fixed); READY_FOR_GO_LIVE didn't advance on SETUP_VALIDATION / didn't demote on step reopen (fixed state machine); stepKey→configDomain mismatch (operating_config→OPERATING etc.) showed "Nothing to configure" (fixed via explicit map); config form saved {} on first save (defaults now seeded into state)
- Regression: smoke.sh updated for designed 307 dashboard redirect → 31/31 PASS; Sunshine demo tenant lazy-init into setup (24%, next=branding)

Stage Summary:
- M00 complete per brief §40 DoD: new preschool reaches LIVE with zero manual DB configuration
- Deliverables: docs/M00_Implementation_Impact_Map.md, engine+APIs+UI live, scripts/m00-e2e.sh reusable
- Screenshots: download/shot-m00-{dashboard,steps,config2,blocked2,settings}.png
- Server: prod build on :3000, PG on :54329, demo accounts unchanged

Task ID: 9
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: M01 — End-to-End Integration (M00 → full preschool lifecycle; 64-section brief)

Work Log:
- Phase 0 FIRST: docs/M01_End_to_End_Integration_Impact_Map.md — 12 config-consumption rows, 15 integration rows (I-1..I-15), RBAC/DB/API/UI deltas, implementation order (no coding before map)
- Schema (additive): +5 enums (ObservationConcern, FollowUpDomain/Severity/Status, StudentAllocationStatus), TimelineEntryType+=HEALTH_CHECK, +2 models (FollowUp, StudentAllocation), +academicSessionId on Attendance/Invoice/TimelineEntry/Observation, Guardian.pickupPin, Observation.category/concern
- FIXED pre-existing cross-tenant bug: applicationNumber & receiptNumber were GLOBAL unique while numbering is per-tenant → tenant-scoped unique + backfilled receipts.tenantId (M01 §53 catch)
- Engine libs: src/lib/config.ts (typed SchoolConfig accessor+defaults), academic.ts (session resolvers), calendar.ts (dayStatus), capacity.ts, followups.ts (raise/transition/resolveByDedupeKey; notification≠resolution), events.ts (in-process domain event seam), notify.ts (funnel over Announcement/TimelineEntry — no second notification engine), integrations.ts (event→FU/notify wiring)
- APIs new: /operations/{today,exceptions,follow-ups,follow-ups/[id],pickup}, /care (GET+POST bulk, config-gated), /teacher/today, /parent/today, /students/[id]/allocate (GET history+POST w/ capacity guard), /applications/[id]/waitlist, /invoices/[id]/remind, /academic-years/[id]/{close,promote}; EXT: attendance (calendar guard+AY+exception events), observations (category/concern→learning FU), invoices (overdue sync+AY+events), payments (PaymentReceived→auto-resolve FU), approve (required-docs gate+FINANCE dueDayOffset+allocation row+events), leads/convert (doc checklist — was missing, broke approve)
- RBAC additive: operations:read/write → PRINCIPAL/COORDINATOR/TEACHER, operations:read → ACCOUNTS; PARENT unchanged
- UI: /app/operations command centre (CRITICAL/ATTENTION/NORMAL bands, sections grid, FU queue w/ resolve), dashboard role-split (TEACHER→TeacherToday quick-tap care+follow-ups; PARENT→ParentToday child-centric), nav Operations (+g-red/ic-red classes), academics composer (category+concern), student detail (allocate modal+history+pickup release), finance remind button
- E2E scripts/m01-e2e.sh: 49/49 PASS — full journey incl. 2 admissions, attendance exceptions, care config-gating, health/incident escalation, learning loop closure, pickup block, overdue→remind→payment→auto-resolve, capacity full block, promote w/ history; fixture m01-fixture.mjs (parent user+guardian link, test harness only)
- Regression: smoke.sh 31/31, m00-e2e.sh 41/41 — M00 untouched
- Bugs fixed during E2E: users API excludes PARENT (by design — fixture), fixture email case (login lowercases), bash quoting in asserts, single-student test data
- Ops: pg-start.sh now self-heals (stale pid, ICU symlinks, runtime dirs, port 54329 re-enforce, .env restore); postgresql.conf sandbox reset to 5432 detected+fixed; server restart = pkill -9 -f next-server + setsid --fork standalone
- Docs: M01_End_to_End_Integration_Impact_Map, PreOne_Domain_Integration_Matrix, PreOne_Problem_Solving_Matrix, PreOne_Child_Lifecycle, PreOne_Daily_Operating_Loop, PreOne_End_to_End_Test_Matrix

Stage Summary:
- M01 DoD met: child journeys enquiry→admission→allocation→daily ops→learning→communication→fees→reports→promotion→next AY with ZERO manual DB intervention; 10 problem scenarios detect→act→communicate→follow-up→resolve→audit
- Known gaps (documented, by design): Transport/Inventory/Leave/Payroll contexts don't exist in MVP (feature flags OFF, Impact Map I-15); AI daily-summary drafting not wired (existing AI gateway untouched); notification channels beyond IN_APP need providers
- Server: prod build :3000; PG :54329 (1+2 tenants); demo accounts unchanged; total automated checks 121 green (49+41+31)

Task: M01 PRODUCT-CONFORMANCE AUDIT (freeze; no code changes)

Work Log:
- Phase 0 freeze: verified baseline (app :3000 OK, PG :54329 restarted, 16 tenants/32 students), suites re-run: 49/49 M01 + 41/41 M00 + 31/31 smoke — claims honest
- 6 parallel read-only inventories: 19 source docs (PRD/DDD/BRC/ERD/ADR-113/ADR-38/ADR series), M01 brief (65 sections, byte-identical pastes), prisma schema + live DB (33 tables/38 enums verified), 61 API routes + 21 libs + middleware, all UI pages + nav, all 3 test scripts classified
- Spot-verified critical defects first-hand (auth.ts wildcard OK; 9 id-addressed routes lack tenantId; payments no idempotency; sequence count-based; audit() swallows errors; login never checks tenant.status)
- Live probes (scripts/audit-probes.sh, audit-probes2.sh, dbq.mjs): 7 CONFIRMED — PR-2 cross-tenant READ student profile; PR-3 cross-tenant WRITE lead; PR-4 cross-tenant PAYMENT ₹1 (invoice PARTIALLY_PAID); PR-5 payment retry = 2 payment rows (no idempotency); PR-6 parent sees 24 tenant invoices vs 2 own-child; PR-7 parent SSR /app/students/{non-child} renders name+INV number; PR-8 capacity TOCTOU 6/6 (cap-1 classroom got 2 ACTIVE allocations)
- Wrote docs/M01_Product_Conformance_Audit.md: 25 phases + verdicts, conflict blocks, live probe log, 26-section final report, P0-P3 remediation, Appendix A (12 doc-level conflicts REQUIRES PRODUCT DECISION), Appendix B evidence index

Stage Summary:
- VERDICT: M01 NOT CONFORMANT — 121 green tests pass but 0/16 negative-path categories covered; every severe defect lives in an untested category
- P0 (no decisions needed): tenant-scope 9 routes; capacity atomic guard; payment idempotency+tx balance; parent invoice/SSR scoping; SSR auth class fix
- 10 product decisions logged (PC-1..PC-10: role canon, admission entity, refunds, AI scope, attendance lock, parent provisioning, Growth Passport name, channels, hash-chain, capacity level)
- Server: prod build :3000 + PG :54329 running; demo accounts unchanged; test-tenant artifacts documented in audit §24

Task: Replace PreOne brand logos with newly uploaded high-definition artwork

Work Log:
- Ingested new transparent RGBA logo upload (media_1789134821925.png) featuring improved typography, cleanly separated lettering ("P", "r", "e", "O", "n", "e"), and refined planet emblem with orbit ring
- Built reproducible asset generation script (`scripts/update-brand-assets.py`) using PIL and NumPy:
  - Master source: saved to `upload/preone_logo.png`
  - Full Wordmark (`public/preone-logo.png` & `download/assets/preone-logo.png`): content-cropped to bounding box and scaled to 1000x470 (LANCZOS, optimized)
  - Planet Emblem Mark (`public/preone-mark.png` & `download/assets/preone-mark.png`): masked planet 'O' + tilted orbit ring with antialiased edge feathering, centered in 512x512 square canvas with balanced padding
  - Next.js Favicon & App Icons (`src/app/icon.png` 128x128, `src/app/apple-icon.png` 180x180)
- Verified all endpoints via live HTTP requests on :3000 (`/preone-logo.png`, `/preone-mark.png`, `/icon.png`, `/apple-icon.png` all returning 200 OK)

Stage Summary:
- New brand logo deployed across the entire application (header, taskbar start menu, login cards, platform onboarding console, favicons, and documentation assets)
