# PreOne Enterprise Error Handling & Observability Architecture

## Architectural Overview

PreOne Enterprise Preschool OS implements a unified, platform-wide Error Handling and Observability pipeline. Every domain module—Setup, Users, Staff, Family, Students, Admissions, Academics, Attendance, Fees, HR, Transport, Inventory, Reports, and Notifications—adheres to the same error contract.

## Key Invariants

1. **Single Trace ID Guarantee**: Generated once per request lifecycle and forwarded consistently across middleware, services, child loggers, HTTP response headers (`X-Trace-Id`), response JSON body (`traceId`), and client UI references.
2. **Operational vs. Developer Taxonomy**: Operational issues are user-remediable and logged at `WARN` level without alarming stacks. Developer issues are logged at `ERROR` level with stack traces, while the client receives a safe, generic message.
3. **PII and Secret Redaction**: Passwords, hashes, tokens, cookies, JWTs, pickup PINs, and payment data are stripped recursively before hitting stdout or audit tables.
4. **Resilient Audit Logging**: If non-transactional audit writing fails, the system logs `AUDIT_WRITE_FAILED` at `WARN` level while preserving the primary user operation.
5. **Spreadsheet CSV Protection**: CSV exports and error reports sanitize leading formula control characters (`=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `\t`, `\r`) to guard against client-side CSV formula injection.
